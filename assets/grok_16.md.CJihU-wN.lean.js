Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.  - \`\` Stellar Ships '' or \`\` Star Ships '' ( Russian name \`\` Zvezdnye Korabli '' , Russian :   ) is a short story by the Soviet writer and paleontologist Ivan Yefremov written in 1944 and first published in 1948 in the USSR . This story is about the discovery of an ancient dinosaur bone with a mysterious bullet hole ( or \`\` blaster hole '' ) and an alien skull and his portrait nearby . This acts as a starting point and a cover story to the philosophical idea of plurality of the mind cradles in the Universe , similarity of planet evolution paths , and similarity of physiology and psychology . Efremov states the final perspective for all civilisations is The Great Circle , which will unite them all .  - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\"  - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - Ivan Antonovich (real patronymic Antipovich) Yefremov (April 22, 1908  October 5, 1972), last name sometimes spelled Efremov, was a Soviet paleontologist, science fiction author and social thinker. He originated taphonomy, the study of fossilization patterns.  - Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.

This post came to me at 10pm last night, on Day 16 of this challenge, after a day of holidaying in London and with my head (and feet) too weary to put finger to touchscreen. Mrs Mc and I had just watched another live instalment of Broadchurch, murder mystery extraordinaire, particularly since in the second series there is no actual fresh murder to investigate. The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music.

Does \\"French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide; and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak.\\" correctly answer the question of Aside from George Sands what two French authors have written about Chopin?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide; and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak.\\" does correctly answer the question of \\"Aside from George Sand, what two French authors have written about Chopin?\\" The two French authors mentioned in the sentence, aside from George Sand, are Marcel Proust and André Gide, both of whom have written about Chopin. Marcel Proust (1871-1922) was a French novelist, critic, and essayist. He is best known for his monumental work, \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" (also known as \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\"), a novel written in seven volumes between 1913 and 1927. In this work, along with other writings, Proust has referenced and written about Chopin, his music, and the impact of the composer on society. Proust's sensitive appreciation of musical aesthetics is evident in his writing and he often mentioned the significance of Chopin as a composer in his character's lives. André Gide (1869-1951) was another influential French author, who wrote novels, essays, and plays. He was a prominent figure in French literature during his time and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1947. Gide also wrote about Chopin and was fascinated by the composer's life and work. In his book \\"Notes on Chopin,\\" Gide elaborated on Chopin's compositions, the importance of his music, and Chopin's extraordinary life as an artist. Moreover, the statement also mentions that Chopin has featured in the works of German expressionist writer Gottfried Benn (1886-1956) and Nobel Prize-winning Russian author Boris Pasternak (1890-1960), highlighting Chopin's extensive impact on the literary world beyond France."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese New Year Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival in modern China, is an important Chinese festival celebrated at the turn of the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. It is one of several Lunar New Years in Asia. Celebrations traditionally run from the evening preceding the first day, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first calendar month. The first day of the New Year falls on the new moon between January 21 and February 20 In 2018, the first day of the Lunar New Year was on Friday, 16 February, initiating the year of the Dog. Is this statement correct \\"can chinese new year fall on valentines day\\"?","output":"The statement \\"Can Chinese New Year fall on Valentine's Day?\\" is theoretically correct, although the likelihood is quite rare. It is important first to understand that Chinese New Year, as mentioned earlier, is a festival that marks the beginning of the new year according to the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. This calendar follows the phases of the moon and the solar year, causing the date of the Chinese New Year to vary, falling between January 21 and February 20 on the Gregorian calendar. Valentine's Day, on the other hand, is celebrated on February 14 on the Gregorian calendar, which is a fixed date. Now, to answer the question, it is technically possible for Chinese New Year to fall on February 14 if the new moon aligns with that date, making it coincide with Valentine's Day. However, this occurrence is quite rare, and in recent history, Chinese New Year has not fallen on Valentine's Day. In the next few decades, based on astronomical predictions, no instance of Chinese New Year falling on February 14 is expected. Despite the low probability, the possibility shouldn't be entirely dismissed in an extended timeline.  So, while the statement is correct in theory, it is crucial to note that the actual chances of this happening are quite low, and it has not occurred in recent years."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"While it is true that cells contain genetic instructions, the answer \\"cows\\" may not be the most appropriate or accurate answer to the question \\"what contains genetic instructions?\\" The reason for this is that cows, being a specific organism, are too narrow of an answer and do not encompass the broad range of organisms and entities that contain genetic instructions. Instead, a more comprehensive and informative answer would be DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The genetic instructions within living organisms are primarily stored in their DNA. DNA is the genetic blueprint for life, as it contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop, survive, and reproduce. It achieves this by storing biological information in the form of a genetic code, which is composed of sequences of four chemical bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The genetic code within DNA is divided into functional units called genes, which are responsible for producing unique proteins or RNA molecules that carry out specific functions within cells. The total collection of genes in an organism is referred to as its genome. Additionally, DNA is found in the cell nuclei of eukaryotes, which include animals, plants, and fungi, and in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea. Although cows, as living organisms, do indeed contain cells with genetic instructions in the form of DNA, they are just one example of the countless species that possess this crucial biological element. Therefore, the most accurate and all-encompassing answer to the question \\"what contains genetic instructions?\\" would be DNA, since it is applicable to all organisms that carry genetic information, including cows but not limited to them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

L'exemple le plus parlant et le plus récent de la manière dont la violence engendre une violence encore plus forte est l'attaque contre les bureaux de l'ONU à Bagdad. Translate to English","output":"The most striking and recent example of how violence begets even stronger violence is the attack on the UN offices in Baghdad. The attack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, took place on August 19, 2003. This tragic event resulted in the deaths of over 20 people, including Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN's Special Representative in Iraq, and the injuring of many more. The organization's offices were targeted by a suicide bomber, who detonated a truck packed with explosives near the building. This devastating act of violence, carried out during a period of instability and ongoing conflict in the country, highlighted the harsh reality that violence often leads to more significant and intense violent reactions. In the case of the UN attack in Baghdad, the repercussions of this destructive incident were felt both in the country and across the international community. The conflict in Iraq began with the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, which aimed to overthrow then-leader Saddam Hussein. Violence and chaos quickly ensued, primarily stemming from sectarian divisions between the Sunni and Shia populations, as well as from the presence of various foreign military forces in the country. Following the invasion, Iraq became a breeding ground for extremist and terrorist groups, leading to brutal acts of violence directed at both the country's citizens and international organizations present in the region. When examining the aftermath of the UN headquarters attack in Baghdad, there are several ways in which the violence of this act spawned even stronger examples of violence within the country and among the international community. Firstly, the bombing deepened the ongoing mistrust and tensions within Iraq, leading to an increase in sectarian conflict between the various ethnic and religious groups. This rift within the population resulted in further violence and devastating loss of life throughout the country, a situation that continues to plague Iraq to this day. Secondly, the attack on the United Nations offices sparked greater concerns and scrutiny from the international community. The bombing was a direct assault on an international symbol of diplomacy and peacekeeping, highlighting the serious threat extremist groups posed not only to Iraq but also to other countries and international bodies. This increased international focus on the situation in Iraq led various countries to escalate their military presence and operations in the region, which in turn fueled more violence and unrest. Lastly, the devastating attack on the UN headquarters in Baghdad had ramifications on humanitarian efforts within Iraq. The United Nations and other non-governmental organizations were forced to re-evaluate their presence and security measures in the country, with many choosing to reduce their staff and operations in the face of increasing risk. This reduction in humanitarian support and resources had dire consequences for the Iraqi people, who were already facing immense challenges in the wake of the invasion and subsequent conflict. In conclusion, the attack on the UN offices in Baghdad serves as a stark example of the way in which violence often leads to even more potent forms of violence and suffering. In this case, the initial act of violence in the form of a brutal suicide bombing incited further conflict, international intervention and an overall climate of fear and distrust. The repercussions of this tragic event continue to reverberate throughout Iraq and shape the ongoing efforts towards peace and stability in the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

Given the question: Question: What does someone committing perjury likely to have?  Choices:  - miscarriage of justice - guilt - testify - lies - truth  The rationale to choose \\"guilt\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","output":"Guilt The rationale to choose \\"guilt\\" as the answer to the question \\"What does someone committing perjury likely to have?\\" comes from understanding the definition of perjury and how it applies in a legal context. Perjury is the act of willfully and knowingly providing false information, especially while under oath in a legal proceeding. To commit perjury, a person must intentionally deceive by telling a lie or making a misleading statement. Considering the given choices: 1. Miscarriage of justice: While perjury can lead to a miscarriage of justice, the act of committing perjury itself does not necessarily mean that someone is causing a miscarriage of justice. It is the potential result or consequence of perjury rather than the state or feeling that the person committing perjury has. 2. Guilt: In this context, guilt refers to the state of being responsible for an offense or wrongdoing - in this case, the act of perjury. As the person committing perjury is knowingly providing false information, they are guilty of the offense of perjury. 3. Testify: To testify means to give evidence as a witness in a legal proceeding, which is not directly related to what someone committing perjury is likely to have. It is rather an action that the person might take while possibly committing perjury. 4. Lies: While someone committing perjury is indeed telling lies, the choice of \\"guilt\\" aligns more closely with the nature of the question. The question is seeking the consequence or state related to committing perjury, which is the guilt associated with that act, rather than the act of lying itself. 5. Truth: This choice is not applicable, as someone committing perjury is intentionally providing false information and not the truth. Given the context of the question, \\"guilt\\" emerges as the most suitable answer because a person committing perjury is likely to have guilt associated with their act of providing false information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Priests and churchgoers alike have tried to remain steadfast in their faith despite the ever-present threat, demonstrating the strength of their community. However, the implementation of the traffic light system at St Teresa's brought both local and international attention to the ongoing violence in Monterrey, prompting the local government and law enforcement agencies to take more decisive action against the rising crime rates. Working together, local authorities and citizens' groups engage in a rigorous battle against drug cartels and the crime associated with them. They strengthen law enforcement, fund rehabilitation programs for addicts, and improve social support initiatives aimed at preventing the youth from falling into the hands of crime syndicates. As the months go by, the collaborative efforts between citizens and authorities start to pay off. The crime rate in Monterrey begins to decrease, making the streets safer. The traffic light system at St Teresa's hardly ever shows a red light, and people once again start gathering at the church without the constant fear for their lives. Church leaders and worshippers alike credit the unyielding strength of their faith and community for overcoming the adversity that violence brought upon Monterrey. While the battle against crime continues, and occasional incidents still occur, the traffic light system serves as a symbol of both the resilience of the community and the power of collective action to effect change. The story of St Teresa of Avila Church does not end with a definite conclusion; instead, it serves as a reminder that fighting back against violence and fear takes a united effort. It also shows the power of faith to help communities remain strong in the face of danger and adversity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: First impressions are usually formed within 30 seconds. The first thing an employer will notice is your physical appearance. Pick a wardrobe that communicates effort and professionalism.  Research the company's dress code going into the interview. If you know anyone from the company, ask them what's appropriate. You can also call the company's Human Resource Department and ask what is recommended in terms of attire. If you're interviewing for a professional, managerial, or executive position you should always wear a suit. Have a few interview suits, preferably tailored to your body, on hand to choose from.  If the attire is business casual, or if you're applying for a lower ranking position, a nice blouse with dress pants or a skirt is a good choice for women. Men can wear dress pants and a button down shirt and tie.  If this is for a factory, construction, or other such job where you will get dirty, wear sensible attire to the interview, this includes steel-toed safety shoes and if it's a construction site, you'll need to wear a hard hat (not a bump hat) to get from the gate to the office. Do not forget footwear. Oftentimes, an outfit is great but shoes are tattered or worn. Invest in comfortable, work-appropriate shoes. Do not fret if you have to pay a little more. Remember, you will use these shoes often when you land a job.  Avoid perfumes and other fragrances, which can appear tacky and put off interviewers. While accessories, like a nice belt or tasteful jewelry, can be a nice touch avoid anything overly flashy or distracting.  If you wear make-up, stick to neutral shades of lipstick, eye-liner, and eye shadow. Your make-up should ideally enhance your existing facial features without overwhelming them. Never go into an interview without prior knowledge of the company. This conveys a lack of interest and respect on your part. Conduct thorough research in the days leading up to an interview.  Know what skills the company values. Look at the career page on their website and pay close attention to the desired qualifications listed on their job postings. This gives you the opportunity to learn more about a given company and discover what aspects of your skill set and career history to emphasize.  Read up on the latest news involving the company. Oftentimes, company websites have a section dedicated to press releases and news coverage. You can also search for the company's name in Google News.  Research the company's mission and values. You'll want to make sure you come off as a good fit for the company's culture. There should be a section on the company's website with a mission statement. You can also follow the company on social media to get a sense of their ethos.  Find out who your interviewer will be. Oftentimes, this is disclosed in the email asking you to come in for an interview. If not, you can politely request their name. Research the interviewer on LinkedIn and Twitter. This increases your chance of connecting and, in turn, landing the job. Concrete is better than abstract when it comes to wowing an interviewer. You should have a few solid anecdotes prepared that speak to your experience.  People tend to remember stories easier than direct information. Therefore, telling a story rather than simply conveying your experience means you'll stand out in an interviewer's mind.  Ask yourself, what are the skill sets this company is looking for? Write down a list of skills and, from there, try to come up with stories from past jobs, volunteer experiences, and internships that illustrate your proficiency with said skills. Have 2 to 3 anecdotes to choose from going in. Rehearse. Recite the stories to yourself to make sure you include all necessary information and don't slip up or stutter during the interview. You can always record yourself speaking and play back the recording to see where you need to improve. It's not uncommon for employers to scan the Twitter and Facebook accounts of potential employees. Make sure your social media presence is clean before going into an interview.  Curse words do not reflect well on you as a potential employee. Make sure any obscenity is removed. A negative attitude can be a deterrent to employment and people often take to Twitter and Facebook to complain. Delete tweets or statues that air grievances about friends, family members, or businesses. If you want to err on the side of caution, you can temporarily deactivate your Facebook or Twitter profile the week before your interview. You can also change privacy settings so only certain posts are visible to the public. Summary:","output":"When going to a job interview, it's important to look nice and know about the company. Wear clothes that show you are serious about the job and make sure your shoes are clean. Don't wear too much makeup, perfume, or flashy things. Learn about the company by looking at their website and news. Practice talking about things you have done that show you have the skills they want. Make sure your social media pages, like Facebook and Twitter, have only good things on them so the company likes you more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? Christopher taught Aaron how to ask a girl to homecoming without failure as  Available options: [a]. Christopher is an extrovert.; [b]. Aaron is an extrovert.;","output":"The sentence ends as follows: Christopher taught Aaron how to ask a girl to homecoming without failure as Christopher is an extrovert. This choice (option [a]) is the more logical ending for the sentence, as it provides a clear explanation for why Christopher has the necessary skills and insights to be able to teach Aaron about successfully asking someone to homecoming. Being an extrovert typically indicates that a person is outgoing, sociable, and comfortable in various social situations. This likely means that Christopher has experience with interacting with people, particularly in the context of events like homecoming. Christopher's extroverted nature suggests that he has a strong understanding of how to approach and communicate with others, as well as a natural ability to navigate social dynamics. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that his extroverted qualities have allowed him to effectively approach and ask girls to homecoming events without experiencing rejection or failure. In turn, he can effectively share his knowledge, experience, and social skills with Aaron, who may be less experienced or less confident in these situations. On the other hand, if the sentence were to end with \\"Aaron is an extrovert\\" (option [b]), the logical connection between the two characters and the skill being taught would be less straightforward. If Aaron were already an extrovert, it would not clearly explain why he needed Christopher's help to ask a girl to homecoming without failure. He would likely already possess the necessary social skills and confidence to approach the girl on his own. In this case, mentioning Aaron's extroverted nature would not provide a strong basis or justification for Christopher's assistance in teaching him about asking someone to homecoming. In conclusion, the more suitable and coherent ending for the sentence is \\"Christopher taught Aaron how to ask a girl to homecoming without failure as Christopher is an extrovert.\\" This choice provides a clear explanation for the source of Christopher's expertise in the matter, as well as the reason behind his ability to effectively guide Aaron through the process of asking a girl to homecoming without failure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: you know it it gives you some strokes there that you may not get otherwise because i'm cooped up in the house all day Sentence 2: I get out of the house often.   Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, these two sentences present contrasting scenarios. The first sentence (\\"you know it it gives you some strokes there that you may not get otherwise because i'm cooped up in the house all day\\") suggests that the speaker is experiencing some benefits from an unspecified activity that they wouldn't receive if they were confined to the house all day. The phrase \\"cooped up in the house all day\\" implies that the speaker is spending the majority of their time indoors and is not able to go outside as much as they would like to. The second sentence (\\"I get out of the house often\\") clearly states that the speaker is able to leave their home frequently. This sentence suggests that the speaker is not confined to their house and has ample opportunities to be outside and engage in various activities. Therefore, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence as they present two contrasting situations. The first sentence describes a scenario where the speaker feels confined to their house, while the second sentence indicates that the speaker has ample opportunities to leave their home and be active outdoors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A toddler holds a large blue ball while playing in the grass.\\" if \\"A toddler playing outside is going to throw a big ball.\\"?","output":"While there are similarities between the two statements, it is not possible to definitively conclude that \\"A toddler holds a large blue ball while playing in the grass\\" if \\"A toddler playing outside is going to throw a big ball.\\" There are multiple factors to consider that prevent us from drawing this conclusion. 1. Color of the ball: The first statement specifies that the ball is blue, while the second statement does not mention the color of the ball. Therefore, we cannot assume the ball is blue based on the information provided in the second statement alone. 2. Size of the ball: In the first statement, the ball is described as large, while in the second statement it is called big. While these words have similar meanings, they could still describe slightly different sizes or be a subjective comparison. It is not guaranteed that they are describing the same ball. 3. Current action of the toddler: The first statement has the toddler holding the ball, while the second statement has the toddler preparing to throw the ball. While both statements mention a toddler with a ball, the actions they are performing with the ball are different.  4. Location of the toddler: The first statement clearly states that the toddler is playing in the grass, whereas the second statement only provides the information that the toddler is playing outside. There are various outside locations other than grassy areas where the toddler could be playing, such as on a sidewalk, in a sandbox, or on a patio.  Due to the differences and lack of specific matching information between the two statements, it is not possible to conclude that the first statement is true based on the second statement.

Would a linguist find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically? Mary claimed that have eaten cabbage, Holly should.","output":"A linguist would likely find that the sentence, \\"Mary claimed that have eaten cabbage, Holly should\\" is not a valid English sentence grammatically. There are several issues with the structure and word choice that would need to be corrected to achieve proper grammaticality. Some of the issues present in the sentence are: 1. Missing auxiliary verb: In the first clause, the verb \\"have\\" is used without a necessary auxiliary verb such as \\"to\\" or \\"should,\\" which is required to form a correct verb phrase. A potential correction could be to use \\"to have\\" or \\"should have\\" instead. 2. Incorrect verb form: The verb \\"eaten\\" following \\"have\\" is the past participle form, which should be used after an auxiliary verb like \\"has\\" or \\"had.\\" In its current form, a linguist would find this usage incorrect. Depending on the intended meaning, the appropriate verb form should be used. For example, \\"Mary claimed that Holly has eaten cabbage\\" or \\"Mary claimed that Holly had eaten cabbage.\\" 3. Unclear referent: The phrase \\"Holly should\\" at the end of the sentence is ambiguous, as it is unclear what action Holly should perform. A more explicit construction would improve clarity, such as stating the action explicitly, e.g., \\"Holly should also eat cabbage.\\" Taking these issues into account, a linguist might suggest revising the sentence to something like: \\"Mary claimed that Holly should have eaten cabbage\\" or \\"Mary claimed that, since she has eaten cabbage, Holly should too.\\" The revised sentences are grammatically correct and convey a clear meaning. In summary, the original sentence \\"Mary claimed that have eaten cabbage, Holly should\\" is not considered a valid English sentence grammatically. After addressing the issues related to the auxiliary verb, verb form, and unclear referent, a revised sentence would be more acceptable to a linguist in terms of grammaticality and clarity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"In that respect, the SEC should reexamine the amount and targeting of its civil sanctions, its use of criminal statutes, and working effectively with the Department of Justice to put violators behind bars when appropriate.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The SEC does not need to change civil sanctions.\\"?","output":"If the premise suggests that the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) should reexamine the amount and targeting of its civil sanctions, its use of criminal statutes, and work effectively with the Department of Justice to put violators behind bars when appropriate, it implies that there might be certain inadequacies or inefficiencies in the current approach. Consequently, this premise challenges the hypothesis that \\"The SEC does not need to change civil sanctions.\\" The SEC is responsible for ensuring transparency, efficiency, and fairness in the securities market, and its regulatory powers include imposing civil sanctions, which are monetary penalties, on market participants who violate the federal securities laws. The premise addresses three crucial aspects of the SEC enforcement process: 1. Civil Sanctions: By suggesting a reexamination of the amount and targeting of civil sanctions, the premise raises concerns about whether current civil sanctions are effective in deterring securities law violations. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of reassessing the appropriateness and proportionality of these sanctions. For instance, the SEC could enforce more severe penalties for more egregious violations and consider factors such as the financial capacity of the violators and the harm caused to investors while determining the amount of the penalty.  2. Use of Criminal Statutes: The premise also touches upon the SEC's need to evaluate its reliance on criminal statutes as a deterrent mechanism. Since criminal charges can lead to incarceration and severe financial penalties, they can serve as a powerful deterrent. However, invoking criminal statutes excessively may also create unintended consequences, such as generating a chilling effect on the market or discouraging businesses from settling with the SEC. Thus, it is crucial for the SEC to strike a balance between using criminal statutes and civil sanctions to achieve its regulatory objectives. 3. Collaboration with the Department of Justice: Effective collaboration between the SEC and the Department of Justice (DOJ) is necessary to ensure that securities laws are enforced consistently and violators are held accountable when they engage in criminal activities. The premise suggests that the SEC needs to improve its cooperation with the DOJ in order to impose the appropriate penalties on market participants who commit securities fraud or manipulate markets. This includes better coordination, sharing of information, and a clear delineation of responsibilities between the two agencies to optimize their efforts in enforcing securities laws. Given these concerns raised by the premise, it is clear that the hypothesis \\"The SEC does not need to change civil sanctions\\" is contradicted. Rather, the premise indicates that reassessing the current civil sanctions regime, enhancing coordination with the DOJ, and finding a balanced approach to using criminal statutes are essential steps for the SEC to improve its enforcement efforts and deter securities law violations more effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

The Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet, originally estimated to be about 1.5 to 3 kilometers in diameter, fragmented into 21 visible pieces due to Jupiter’s strong tidal forces during a close approach in 1992. These fragments, nicknamed \\"string of pearls\\" because of their appearance, were on a collision course with Jupiter and hit the planet over a period of 6 days. The impacts, visible from Earth-based telescopes, created plumes of superheated gas and debris, marking Jupiter with a ring of dark spots that were thousands of miles across. These impacts provided astronomers precious information about the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere as well as the structure of the comet itself. The extreme velocity of the impacts, estimated to be around 60 km/second, generated a great amount of energy, with the largest fragment yielding an explosion equivalent to six million mega tons of TNT (for comparison, the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima had an output of about 15 kilotons of TNT). These events put comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on the map as one of the most studied comets in history, providing unprecedented data about comets and impact events, furthering our understanding of the dynamics of our solar system. Indeed, the statement that the Shoemaker-Levy comet hit Jupiter is in perfect alignment with the preceding text."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Start by thinking of the letter \\"b\\" as a special hidden number we're trying to find. And we have it on both sides of the equals sign, don't we? Let's simplify this, like when we tidy up our toys. So, first let's gather all terms with \\"b\\" on one side of the equals sign and the other numbers on the other side. Let's subtract 135*b from both sides of the equation. If you subtract something on one side of the balance, you need to subtract the same thing on the other side to keep it even.  So equation will become: 8389 = 879*b - 135*b - 46667. Subtracting 879*b - 135*b gives 744*b, so you have: 8389 = 744*b - 46667. Then, let's move that 46667 over to the other side, by adding 46667 to both sides of the equation. That keeps it balanced. This simplifies to: 8389 + 46667 = 744*b. If you add those together, you get 55056 = 744*b. Our last step to find what \\"b\\" is is to divide 55056 by 744. This is just like splitting a whole bunch of candies evenly into bags. So, \\"b\\" equals 55056 divided by 744. If you do the math, \\"b\\" turns out to be about 74. And that's it!

Tony Hall visit the country next week to assess a humanitarian crisis that has festered since the Gulf War of 1990, Hall's office said Monday. The Dayton Democrat, who has traveled to other crisis points including Sierra Leone and North Korea, will spend three days visiting hospitals and other facilities to seek understanding why aid has been ineffective in stemming malnourishment and other medical problems. Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended, which some say have thwarted the country's ability to recover from the devastation of the bombing campaign. The Persian Gulf War destroyed much of the country's medical infrastructure, according to a report by the World Health Organization. In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population existed in a state of \`\`semi-starvation.'' Hall will be only the second member of Congress to travel in Iraq since the war, according to Hall's office. The last visitor was then-U.S. Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who went to help a pair of U.S. oilmen in diplomatic trouble. Hall flies to Amman, Jordan, on Friday, where he'll spend the night before driving to Iraq.

Process: - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born.  Question: suppose during pollination happens, how will it affect MORE butterflies.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The process of pollination, when applied to the life cycle of butterflies, has a significant effect on the growth of their population. It ultimately results in more butterflies being born. To understand how this occurs, it's essential to delve into the role butterflies play in pollination and its connection to their life cycle. Butterflies hold a crucial role in the process of pollination, as they are efficient pollinators, carrying pollen from one flower to another while seeking nectar. Nectar is a primary source of sustenance for butterflies and provides the energy and nutrients they need to lay their eggs. When butterflies pollinate more flowers, it not only increases the chances of fertilization and seed production in the plants but also boosts the availability of nectar for butterflies. This increase in nectar availability ensures a reliable food source for adult butterflies and supports an environment that is more suitable for egg deposition and survival of the subsequent caterpillars. During the butterfly life cycle, the caterpillars feed on different plants called host plants. A successful pollination event would increase the abundance of these host plants, allowing for an increase in food sources for the caterpillars. This would improve their chances of survival and growth until they can form cocoons, transform into pupae, and hatch into adult butterflies. So, examining the life cycle of a butterfly and its role in pollination, we can observe that an increase in pollination events positively affects the butterfly population in several ways: 1. More nectar is available for adult butterflies, providing them with the necessary energy to mate and lay eggs. 2. A higher abundance of host plants for caterpillars ensures a stable food source, allowing them to grow bigger before entering the cocoon stage. 3. A healthy environment with plentiful host plants also decreases predation and competition, leading to more caterpillars reaching the pupa stage and eventually becoming adult butterflies. Thus, the supposed perturbation of increased pollination ultimately influences the second effect mentioned (the caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger) positively, leading to more butterflies being born as a result. In conclusion, increasing pollination has a direct and positive effect on the butterfly population as it enhances the availability of food for both adult butterflies and caterpillars and supports a thriving ecosystem where more caterpillars can successfully transform into butterflies. This results in the birth of more butterflies in the wild."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: The coast? I asked, puzzled.  Hypothesis: The coast made perfect sense.  Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis, \\"The coast made perfect sense,\\" is not directly entailed by the premise, \\"The coast? I asked, puzzled.\\" To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must first analyze both statements and their relationship to each other. In the premise, the speaker is questioning the mention of the coast and expressing puzzlement or confusion. This suggests that, at least initially, the idea of the coast does not make perfect sense to the speaker. The premise serves as an introduction of the coast as a potential topic of discussion, and it does not provide specific context or information on why the coast may or may not make sense. The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the coast made perfect sense. This statement is more of a conclusion rather than a component of the premise itself. In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, there should be additional context or information provided in the premise or between the premise and hypothesis that reveals a logical progression from the initial puzzlement to an understanding of why the coast makes perfect sense. Therefore, based on the provided information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise merely presents the confusion or puzzlement of the speaker and does not imply any specific outcome or realization. It is entirely possible that further discussion or context could lead to the speaker understanding why the coast makes perfect sense, but that is not provided in the premise alone. To conclude, the hypothesis \\"The coast made perfect sense,\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"The coast? I asked, puzzled,\\" as there is no direct logical progression between the two statements. There may be potential circumstances where the hypothesis could be true after further investigation, but it is not inherently entailed or guaranteed by the premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Madrasa In Singapore, madrasahs are private schools which are overseen by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS, English: Islamic Religious Council of Singapore). There are six Madrasahs in Singapore, catering to students from Primary 1 to Secondary 4. Four Madrasahs are coeducational and two are for girls. Students take a range of Islamic Studies subjects in addition to mainstream MOE curriculum subjects and sit for the PSLE and GCE 'O' Levels like their peers. In 2009, MUIS introduced the \\"Joint Madrasah System\\" (JMS), a joint collaboration of Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah primary school and secondary schools Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah (offering the ukhrawi, or religious stream) and Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah (offering the academic stream). The JMS aims to introduce the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme into the Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah by 2019. Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including the songkok for boys and tudong for girls, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state. For students who wish to attend a mainstream school, they may opt to take classes on weekends at the madrasah instead of enrolling full-time.

Write an article based on this \\"Mental health patients having to travel as far as 79 miles (127km) for a bed is \\"not acceptable\\", the charity Mind has said.\\"","output":"Title: Mental Health Patients Forced to Travel Long Distances for Treatment: A Call for Change Step 1: Provide background information To begin drafting the article, I will provide essential background information about the issue presented by the charity Mind, which reports that mental health patients are having to travel up to 79 miles (127km) for a bed. This will give readers a clear understanding of the problem at hand. The mental healthcare system has long been under strain due to the growing number of people needing support and treatment in many parts of the world. Access to quality mental healthcare services is of paramount importance for those suffering from psychological disorders, but lack of resources and inadequate infrastructure has made receiving timely care difficult for many. Recently, the charity Mind has highlighted an alarming issue—mental health patients are being forced to travel up to 79 miles (127km) to access inpatient treatment. Step 2: Discuss the implications of long-distance travel on mental health patients Next, I will discuss the potential consequences of long-distance travel on mental health patients, focusing on the emotional toll and barriers to treatment it may create. The need for patients to travel such considerable distances for treatment creates multiple barriers. For many individuals, the emotional stress of leaving their family and support network can exacerbate their symptoms, making the journey to receive treatment an agonizing experience. Furthermore, the financial burden of travel and accommodation may be prohibitive for many seeking help, leading to a delay in receiving critical care. Step 3: Present Mind's statement and stance on the issue After discussing the implications of long-distance travel, I will present the charity Mind's statement on the issue and their stance regarding the problem. Mind, a leading mental health charity, has called the current situation \\"not acceptable.\\" The organization argues that the lack of available beds in local facilities is representative of a broader problem within the mental healthcare system, where the needs of patients are not being adequately met. Ensuring that inpatient treatment is available closer to home could limit the detention of patients under the Mental Health Act and, in turn, lead to quicker recovery times and improved access to support services for patients and families. Step 4: Highlight potential solutions to address the issue Finally, I will discuss some potential solutions that could address the problem, emphasizing the need for systemic reform within the mental healthcare sector. To address the issue of mental health patients having to travel long distances for treatment, a multifaceted approach is required. Governments and local healthcare providers must invest in more inpatient beds to accommodate the needs of their communities. Additionally, it is crucial to strengthen community mental health programs, particularly in underfunded and underserved areas. By providing more comprehensive outpatient services, patients may be less likely to need inpatient care. Lastly, addressing the root causes of mental health issues through education, stigma reduction, and promotion of overall well-being may help reduce the strain on the entire mental health system. In conclusion, the harrowing experiences of mental health patients travelling long distances for essential treatment highlights an urgent need for reform within the mental healthcare system. By investing in resources, infrastructure, and community support, we can create a more compassionate and effective approach to mental health care that benefits all those in need."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary.  His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing.  The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church.  As he neared the stile which admitted to the road he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the head of a man.  At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw.  But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road.  As he did so he glanced back.  A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it.  He was now bending down, probably with the object of concealing his identity, and had moved on a few paces farther down the road.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"After Gifford glances back, how much farther down the road had Henshaw traveled?\\" is \\"Low Faces\\"?","output":"The correct answer to the question \\"After Gifford glances back, how much farther down the road had Henshaw traveled?\\" is not \\"Low Faces.\\" Instead, the answer can be found in the last line of the paragraph, where it states, \\"He [Henshaw] was now bending down, probably with the object of concealing his identity, and had moved on a few paces farther down the road.\\" Thus, the answer should be that Henshaw had traveled \\"a few paces\\" farther down the road after Gifford glanced back.

Information:  - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada.  - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area.  - Mek We Dweet is a studio album by Jamaican reggae singer Burning Spear . It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album at the 33rd Grammy Awards in 1991 .  - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it.  - Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of the artists concerned, including the spiritual side of Rastafari and the honoring of God, called Jah by Rastafari. It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa.  - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938  November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle.  - Winston Rodney OD (born 1 March 1945), better known by the stage name Burning Spear, is a Jamaican roots reggae singer and musician. Burning Spear is a Rastafarian and one of the most influential and long-standing roots artists to emerge from the 1970s.  - Mento is a style of Jamaican folk music that predates and has greatly influenced ska and reggae music. Mento typically features acoustic instruments, such as acoustic guitar, banjo, hand drums, and the rhumba box  a large mbira in the shape of a box that can be sat on while played. The rhumba box carries the bass part of the music.  - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic.

In Osbert: A Portrait of Osbert Lancaster, Boston comments that after the dramatic events in Athens his subject's later life was uneventful and industrious with \\"a somewhat dismaying dearth of rows, intrigues, scandals or scrapes to report.\\" The Lancasters had a Georgian house in Henley-on-Thames, and a flat in Chelsea, where they lived from Mondays to Fridays. He worked at home in the mornings, on illustrations, stage designs, book reviews and any other commissions, before joining his wife for a midday dry martini and finally dressing and going to one of his clubs for lunch. After that he would walk to the Express building in  Fleet Street at about four in the afternoon. There he would gossip with his colleagues before sitting at his desk smoking furiously, producing the next day's pocket cartoon.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

Under-watering and over-watering can cause a variety of non-specific symptoms that sometimes overlap with other peace lily ailments. However, since improper watering is also one of the easiest problems to fix, try attempting these remedies first before moving on to a more drastic solution.  Under-watering should be fairly obvious: dry soil accompanied with wilting, yellowing leaves and a drooping stalk is a dead giveaway. Fix this by watering and misting more regularly - at least once a week for each. Note that plants that outgrow their containers will have a difficult time absorbing the water they need from a typical watering session. Over-watering can be slightly harder to diagnose, but is often characterized by brown leaf tips. Note that over-watering can lead to root rot, a separate, much more serious condition. Root rot is serious condition that can affect any potted plant with roots below the surface and can easily kill the plant. Generally, root rot is caused when a plant suffers from over-watering or poor drainage. If the roots are held in contact with standing water for a prolonged period of time, it becomes difficult for them to get the air that they need to function correctly, and as a result they will literally begin to rot. Certain types of microorganisms called water moulds contribute to the spreading rot, the spores of which can spread root rot to another plant if adequate moisture is present. Root rot is often fatal, but, to attempt to remedy it, immediately remove your lily from its pot and cut off any dead, slimy, or otherwise rotten portions of root. Pot the plant in a new pot with dry soil and proper drainage.  Though root rot infects the plant below the surface, it will cause the plant to visibly begin to die above ground. If your lily seems to become increasingly wilted even with proper sun and frequent watering, root rot is likely the culprit. Peace lilies are sometimes susceptible to infection by aphids, mites, or other small arthropods. If you notice your lily's leaves begin to wilt or die, especially if accompanied by visible pests, a sticky, slimy discharge, or the presence of white webbing, it's likely that your plant has a pest infestation. Use a strong stream of water to blast the pests off of the plant, then, to make sure they don't return, use a plant-safe insecticide or this homemade recipe for insecticidal soap: Combine 1 Tbsp. (15 ml) vegetable oil, 3 Tbsp (16 g) cayenne pepper, and 1 Tbsp. (12 g) natural fat-derived soap (not liquid dish soap) in 1 quart (.95 liters) of warm water. Use a spray bottle to give your plant a thorough coating, but not  before testing on a small part of  the plant and leaving the soap in place for a day to ensure it doesn't cause any damage. Fungus infections can range from harmless to potentially fatal. If you see a white or grey fuzzy growth on the surface of the soil, you don't need to be terribly concerned, as this fungus is not a danger to the plant (though it can irritate some humans, especially those susceptible to allergies). To clear this minor fungal growth, you may want to try sprinkling cinnamon (which has anti-fungal properties) on the  fungus. However, if the lily itself develops a dark or black coating on its stalk or leaves for no other apparent reason (frost damage, etc.), your plant likely has a serious fungal infection. Discarding the entire plant is always a viable option in this case, as fungal spores can be very persistent, remaining in the soil and surrounding area for a significant amount of time, where they can re-infect other plants. However, if you'd like to try to save the plant, carefully remove all the affected areas of the plant and discard them somewhere that they'll pose no danger. (like your garbage). Next, water the plant with compost tea, a natural fungicide, to attempt to kill spores that remain in the soil. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the common problems associated with growing peace lilies, focusing on improper watering, root rot, pest infestations, and fungal infections.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine.  suppose you exercise often happens, how will it affect bad waste is not removed.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation would be indirectly impacting a step of the process.  Exercise and other physical activities can greatly impact your body's hydration levels, and since kidneys play an essential role in fluid balance and the removal of waste, their performance can be influenced indirectly by these activities. If you're exercising a lot and not adequately replacing the fluids lost through sweat, you can become dehydrated. This makes the kidneys' job of filtering blood and balancing fluids more difficult, potentially leading to less efficient removal of waste. It should be noted, however, that this would be due to not properly managing hydration while exercising, rather than the act of exercising itself. Good hydration practices can help make sure the kidneys are working at their best, regardless of levels of physical activity. Furthermore, regular exercise is generally beneficial for overall health, including kidney health. Therefore, the potential impact on the kidney function and waste removal due to exercise is typically indirect, via fluid balance and hydration, rather than a direct alteration of the physiological processes involved in waste processing in the kidneys. It's an external factor affecting the conditions under which the kidney operates, not changing the steps of the process itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.  Paragraph: Jonathan is attending a football game for his favorite team. Before the game, there will be a fireworks display and a fly over by some jet fighter planes. Jonathan has been looking forward to the fireworks for weeks because he has heard they are really great. The fireworks begin and their sound waves are of a high intensity. After the fireworks, the jets fly over and the sound waves for that has an even higher intensity than the fireworks did.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sound less likely damaged Jonathan's ears? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we can closely examine the details provided in the paragraph: 1. The fireworks create sound waves of high intensity. 2. The jets create sound waves of even higher intensity than the fireworks. Since the paragraph only provides a comparison between the intensity of the fireworks and jets, we cannot determine the exact decibel levels of each. However, we know that higher decibel levels are more likely to cause ear damage. Based on the information available, the fireworks sound was less intense than that of the jets flying over. Therefore, the fireworks sound is less likely to have caused damage to Jonathan's ears in comparison to the sound of the jets."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the following context:  If the pigeon became alert, it would often stretch out its head and neck in line with its body and tail, then nod its head in a circular pattern. When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised its wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it.The passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other to access water, and if necessary, the species could alight on open water to drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long a wild pigeon lived.The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of pre-Columbian forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by white oaks. This species germinated in the fall, therefore making its seeds almost useless as a food source during the spring breeding season, while red oaks produced acorns during the spring, which were devoured by the pigeons. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed consumption may have contributed to the modern dominance of red oaks. Due to the immense amount of dung present at roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the accumulation of flammable debris (such as limbs broken from trees and foliage killed by excrement) at these sites may have increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires, which would have favored fire-tolerant species, such as bur oaks, black oaks, and white oaks over less fire-tolerant species, such as red oaks, thus helping to...  answer the following question:  What was the youngest Martha could have been when she died?

Q:Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with. The unnerving strangeness and disorientation hat comes with knowing that your life has changed and the culture shock that comes with that is so scary and desensitizes you on that first day. Who showed him the room?  A. his siblings  B. his girlfriend  C. his foster parents  D. not enough information A:","output":"The detailed situation you've described highlights the overwhelming sense of unfamiliarity and disorientation that someone might experience when transitioning to a new living situation, particularly in the context of foster care. In this case, the 14-year-old narrator was relocated from a facility for homeless children in Manhattan to a foster home in an unknown location, possibly in Eastern Queens or the Bronx. The sudden change in environment, the unknowns about the new home, and the lack of clear communication contribute to the anxiety and disorientation that the narrator is experiencing. As for the question about who showed the narrator his room, the answer is C. his foster parents. According to the narrative, after arriving at the new home, the foster parents showed the narrator his room and left a plate of food on the table for him. Following this, they went into their bedroom, which was likened to pilots barricading themselves behind a fortified cockpit door. The living situation itself had elements that contributed to the unsettled feeling the narrator experienced. The lack of locks on bedroom and bathroom doors, bars on the windows, and the presence of other unfamiliar youth in the house added to the sense of chaos and lack of control. Additionally, the narrator had very little information about his new environment, including how to get to his high school and the names of his new foster siblings. This story highlights the importance of ensuring that children in foster care have access to adequate support, clear communication, and resources to help them transition into their new environments. Such an effort can alleviate some of the fear and disorientation that can come with a major life change. It is essential for foster parents and support workers to prioritize creating a welcoming and safe environment, and to provide the necessary information that will help ease the transition for youth placed in their care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 million barrels (160×10^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.

Answer this question: what genre of music does cardi b sing??","output":"Cardi B, born as Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, is a multi-talented American rapper, songwriter, and television personality known for her vibrant personality and distinctive musical style. Though her music draws from various genres, it primarily falls within the realm of hip hop and rap. One of the key reasons behind Cardi B's success in the music industry is her unique style, which effectively merges different musical elements. Here's an in-depth look at the aspects that characterize her musical orientations: 1. Hip Hop and Rap: Cardi B's music is heavily influenced by hip hop and rap, which originated in African American and Latinx communities during the 1970s. These genres involve rhythmically spoken lyrics, also known as rapping, over beats often created from existing recordings. Cardi B's breakout hit \\"Bodak Yellow\\" displayed her lyrical prowess, and her debut album \\"Invasion of Privacy\\" cemented her position among the top rap artists. 2. Trap: Cardi B incorporates elements of trap music into her songs. Trap is a subgenre of hip hop, characterized by dark, aggressive beats, ominous atmospheres, and lyrics that centre around themes of drugs, violence, and life in the \\"trap\\" (referring to impoverished urban areas). Notable singles, such as \\"Bartier Cardi\\" and \\"Money,\\" retain this trap influence. 3. Reggaeton and Latin Trap: As an artist of Dominican-Trinidadian descent, Cardi B also embraces her Latin roots in some of her songs. She has collaborated with popular Latin artists like Bad Bunny and J Balvin on the track \\"I Like It,\\" which samples a traditional Latin boogaloo song while incorporating modern reggaeton and Latin trap elements. Her collaboration with Ozuna on \\"La Modelo\\" and her feature in Anitta's \\"Me Gusta\\" are further examples of Cardi B's versatility and engagement with Latin music. 4. R&B and Pop: While primarily a hip hop and rap artist, Cardi B also dabbles in R&B and pop, making her music accessible to a wider audience. Her collaborations with artists from different musical backgrounds, such as pop icons Bruno Mars (\\"Finesse\\" and \\"Please Me\\") and Maroon 5 (\\"Girls Like You\\"), are testaments to her ability to cross and blend genres. In summary, while Cardi B is rooted in hip hop and rap, she fuses various genres like trap, reggaeton, Latin trap, R&B, and pop to create a distinctive sound. Her unique approach to music has brought her both commercial success and critical acclaim, solidifying her position as a force to be reckoned within the modern music scene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Phat Burrito doesn't look like much from the outside, just a rundown, brightly colored cinder block building. But this place has some of the best burritos in Charlotte.  These burritos are not only massive, but filled with fresh ingredients you can't get at the franchise burrito joints. There are several options of burritos, but their menu isn't that extensive. Don't go here looking for a Mexican restaurant, go here only if you want burritos or quesadillas. From black to pinto, chicken to beef to fish, & several other options, Phat Burrito provides enough of an option for the whole group to enjoy the kind of burrito each person likes. The salsa bar also has some different options to top your burrito with, & you can try as many as you wish.  This place is pretty tiny, with not much room for indoor eating. When the weather is nice, the patio is a good option & is right next to the light rail. The lunch crowd is always huge & most people take their food as takeout, so expect to wait a good while to order, & wait for seating as well if you plan to stay. The parking lot can sometimes be a hassle as well.  Phat Burrito is so much better than your normal Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. types. Phat Burrito gives you a much better tasting burrito, without a high price, & will have you going back again & again to this unique little joint.

The story unravels the dark secrets that each of these individuals has been hiding, and how the consequences of their actions led to the eventual deaths of all seven passengers. Act 1: The film opens with the introduction of all seven main characters as they board a commercial flight from Los Angeles to London for their varying personal reasons. The characters include: 1. Richard, a successful businessman with a shady past. 2. Emily, a grieving mother who recently lost custody of her child. 3. Sarah, an introverted artist running away from an abusive relationship. 4. Max, a former surgeon turned drug addict. 5. Daniel, a con-man on the run from law enforcement. 6. Jennifer, an escort looking for a fresh start in a new city. 7. Stephen, a flight attendant with a hidden agenda. Act 2: As the flight takes off, the audience begins to get a glimpse into the hidden lives and tragic pasts of each of these seven characters. Throughout the flight, their stories are gradually interwoven through actions, dialogues, and flashbacks. The following subplots unravel: 1. Richard's criminal history surfaces, revealing that his business dealings are associated with illegal activities. 2. Emily struggles emotionally throughout the flight, reminiscing about the events that led to the loss of her child. 3. Sarah's past is revealed through flashbacks of her abusive relationship, and it becomes clear that she is slowly trying to break free. 4. Max continuously battles his drug addiction as he is confronted by ghosts from his past, causing him to question everything he left behind. 5. Daniel, a seasoned hustler, sees an opportunity to scam some of the passengers and even the flight crew with his charms and quick thinking. 6. Jennifer, feeling cornered by her new-found companions, contemplates jumping off the plane, in an attempt to escape from her dark past. 7. Stephen's hidden agenda gradually unfolds as he is revealed to be an undercover federal agent tasked with apprehending a fugitive on board. Act 3: As the plot reaches its climax, the plane experiences a sudden, catastrophic engine failure. The pilot makes a desperate distress call, and it becomes apparent that the characters' lives are hanging by a thread as the plane rapidly loses altitude. As they brace for impact, each character confronts the consequences of their actions and comes to terms with their fateful connection. Richard confesses his corrupt undertakings; Emily finds solace in Sarah's story, while Sarah decides to confront her abuser upon landing; Max swears off drugs and vows to turn his life around, while Daniel gives up his life of crime and returns the money he swindled from the passengers; Jennifer tries to find a reason to live, and Stephen admits to being an undercover agent. In an intense and dramatic moment, the pilot manages to make an emergency landing in the Atlantic Ocean. While the characters initially survive the crash landing, each one of them ultimately succumbs to their injuries or drowning. The film ends on a poignant note, as their intertwined stories create a haunting requiem for the Lethal Seven. In conclusion, \\"The Lethal Seven\\" tells the thrilling and heart-wrenching story of seven strangers, each battling their demons and, in the process, becoming entwined in each other's lives and fates. The dramatic plane crash and the aftermath that follows test the limits of human resilience, courage, and forgiveness until the deadly connection among them unfolds."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: \\"Hey, guy.\\" \\"No, this is Ray.\\" He smiled, leaned back in his chair.

Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Yes, the answer addresses the question about the location of a bird's cochlea, but it could be more detailed and informative. Allow me to provide an expanded response. A bird's cochlea is situated within the inner ear, just as it is in mammals and other vertebrates. The primary function of the cochlea is to convert sound vibrations into electrical signals which are then transmitted to the brain for processing and interpretation. While mammalian cochleae typically have a spiral shape, the avian cochlea has a different structure, being straight and shorter compared to its mammalian counterpart. This difference in shape contributes to the variation in hearing capabilities between birds and mammals. The avian inner ear can be divided into three main parts: the semicircular canals, the vestibule, and the cochlea. The semicircular canals are responsible for detecting changes in head position and maintaining balance, while the vestibule, specifically the utricle and saccule, also play a role in maintaining balance as well as sensing linear acceleration. The bird's cochlea, also known as the lagena or basilar papilla, is situated near the junction of the semicircular canals and the vestibule. The cochlea has a straight and tubular structure that contains a fluid-filled cavity and sensory hair cells. These specialized hair cells detect sound vibrations and convert them into electrical signals to be sent to the brain for interpretation. The auditory nerve, which connects the inner ear to the brain, is responsible for transmitting these electrical signals. Birds possess fewer hair cells in their cochlea compared to mammals, which is one of the reasons for their generally narrower hearing range. In summary, a bird's cochlea is located in the inner ear, adjacent to the semicircular canals and the vestibule. Although its structure is different from its mammalian counterpart, it serves the same purpose of detecting sound vibrations and converting them into electrical signals for the brain to process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on. The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances. Ma called, \\"Little Bit has to use the bathroom.\\" I yelled, \\"I'm almost done.\\" Ma called, \\"Are you off the toilet?\\" I yelled, \\"Yes!\\" Ma opened the door and brought Little Bit in.

Considering them individually: - herpes: This could happen when kissing anyone, anywhere if one person has the herpes virus. However, it's not explicitly tied to kissing outside. - sexual stimulation: It's a psychological response and can happen anywhere, not specifically tied with outside. - catch cold: This is a more likely result of being outside in cold weather, especially if not properly bundled up, but it's not directly associated with the act of kissing. - outburst: This is quite vague and largely depends on the individuals and the circumstances, so it is not a common sense answer. - get cold: Like catching a cold, this could happen due to being outside in cold weather, particularly if not properly dressed for the conditions. Justifying all these points, the option that makes the most sense when kissing outside, by process of elimination through relevance, is 'get cold'.

It is not suitable as an upgrade from a small cabin because it doesn't generally represent a living accommodation or an improvement in that aspect. 4. palace - Although a palace could be considered an upgrade from a small cabin, due to its large and luxurious nature, it might be excessive and unrealistic as an available option for an upgrade. 5. hotel - Hotels are well-known for offering accommodations and can offer different levels of services and room sizes, making them a possible upgrade from a small cabin. After carefully analyzing each option, the most plausible and contextually fitting answer is 'villa'.

There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette.

This warms the skin so heat can be given off to the environment. That’s why you may get flushed, or red in the face, when you exercise on a hot day. You are likely to sweat as well. Sweating also reduces body heat. Sweat wets the skin, and when it evaporates, it cools the body. Evaporation uses energy, and the energy comes from body heat. Animals with fur, such as dogs, use panting instead of sweating to lose body heat (see Figure below ).

Background: Robert Lee \\"Bullet Bob\\" Hayes (December 20, 1942 - September 18, 2002) was an Olympic sprinter turned American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University. He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009. Context: At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter. First, he won the 100m and in doing so tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly chewed up the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn't realize until he got there. This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4x100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds).  His come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is the fastest in history. Jocelyn Delecour, France's anchor leg runner, famously said to Paul Drayton before the relay final that, \\"You can't win, all you have is Bob Hayes.\\" Drayton was able to reply afterwards, \\"That's all we need.\\" The race was also Hayes' last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it, aged only 21.  In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 meters, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics. His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds. Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years. The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equaled the time in 1976).  Until the Tokyo Olympics, world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. This was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds, and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the \\"Night of Speed\\" in 1968. Question: Where was the 1964 Summer Olympics at?

Summarize this article: This means never sharing them in emails or chats.  It is also advisable to use a password manager like Last Pass or Keepass, which encrypts stored passwords until you need them. Some browsers give you the option of saving your passwords when you visit certain websites.  If you are not the only person using your computer, this means any other user can see your banking info, emails, or other personal data. Password protect files that you do not wish for others to see and/or consider saving sensitive files to a passport drive that can be stored within a personal safe or safety deposit box. The new generation of virus doesn't just damage your computer.  Trojans can take information from your hard-drive, even controlling your computer's camera and taking pictures while you don't notice.  Ransomware can encrypt all information on a hard drive, refusing to return it until a fee is paid. Although it can be tempting to use an unsecured connection when we don’t want to pay for wi-fi, viewing any sensitive or private information on an unsecured network means that it can be viewed by others as well. ” Phishing is when you receive an email from someone posing as a legitimate person, website or service provider that you trust, asking you for sensitive financial or personal account information.  Legitimate service providers will never ask you for this kind of information through email, as it would expose you to security risk.  If you receive an email of this nature, most email platforms have a “Report” function to inform the provider of this threat so it can be neutralized. Dispose of e-waste properly.  Before recycling old hard-drives—even non-functional ones—ensure any personal information is removed by doing a final “wipe.” This ensures that anyone who may attempt to mine it for information will not be able to do so.

She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision.  Would Jennifer see more or less sunsets in Malarn?  Hint: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. A:","output":"Jennifer would likely see more red sunsets in Malarn due to the dust in the air from the desert located across the ocean. The dust particles in the air scatter sunlight, which results in an increase in red sunsets.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

If the answer can be found in the passage, label it as \\"span\\". If the answer is a number, label as \\"number\\". Similarly, label \\"date\\" if you think the answer to the given question is a date. Passage: Charleston is a popular tourist destination, with a considerable number of hotels, inns, and bed and breakfasts, numerous restaurants featuring Lowcountry cuisine and shops. Charleston is also a notable art destination, named a top-25 arts destination by AmericanStyle magazine. Commercial shipping is important to the economy. The city has two shipping terminals, owned and operated by the South Carolina Ports Authority, which are part of the fourth-largest container seaport on the East Coast and the thirteenth-largest container seaport in North America. Charleston is becoming a popular location for information technology jobs and corporations, and this sector has had the highest rate of growth between 2011 and 2012, due in large part to the Charleston Digital Corridor. In 2013, the Milken Institute ranked the Charleston region as the ninth-best performing economy in the US because of its growing IT sector. Notable companies include Blackbaud, SPARC, BoomTown, CSS, and Benefitfocus. In June 2017, the mean sales price for a home in Charleston was 351,186 and the median price was 260,000.

They constitute about 30% of the known butterfly species.  - Polyommatinae, the blues, are a subfamily of gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae). It was long used to assign taxa of unclear relationships, and its contents are in need of revision. Several genera might not even belong here.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Nabokovia is a Neotropical genus of butterflies , named by Arthur Francis Hemming in honour of Vladimir Nabokov , who extensively studied the Polyommatinae subfamily . Species include : Nabokovia faga ( Dognin 1895 )    What is the relationship between 'nabokovia' and 'lycaenidae'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Nabokovia is a Neotropical genus of butterflies belonging to the Polyommatinae subfamily, which is a subfamily of the gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae).

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To increase anti-depression hormones naturally, we will focus on activities and lifestyle changes that boost serotonin and endorphin levels. These neurotransmitters are responsible for regulating mood and promoting a sense of well-being. I will outline a few methods, along with justifications for each step, to help achieve this goal: 1. Exercise regularly    - Regular physical activity increases endorphin production, which helps improve mood and lower stress.    - Include a mix of aerobic activity (e.g., running, biking) and strength training for optimal results. 2. Eat a balanced diet    - Diet plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy serotonin levels.    - Include foods rich in tryptophan – an amino acid that is the precursor to serotonin – such as eggs, dairy, lean meat, nuts, and seeds.    - Consume complex carbohydrates like whole grains, legumes, and starchy vegetables as they encourage the release of insulin, which helps tryptophan enter the brain.    - Eat regularly and avoid extreme diets or long periods of hunger to maintain stable blood sugar levels and reduce mood swings. 3. Get adequate sleep    - Sleep is essential for the overall well-being, and a lack of sleep can negatively impact mood and emotional health.    - Aim for at least 7-9 hours of sleep per night to allow the body and mind to rest and regenerate, helping maintain hormonal balance. 4. Manage stress    - Chronic stress has been linked to decreased serotonin levels.    - Engage in stress-reduction activities such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation to help regulate mood and increase serotonin production. 5. Surround yourself with a positive social circle    - Interacting with loved ones and supportive people increases feelings of happiness, belonging, and self-worth, all of which can boost serotonin levels.    - Participate in group activities, maintain strong friendships, and seek out support when needed. 6. Spend time in nature    - Exposure to sunlight can increase serotonin production and help regulate circadian rhythms, which are essential for a balanced mood.    - Aim to spend at least 30 minutes outdoors daily, weather permitting. 7. Practice gratitude    - Fostering a sense of gratitude and focusing on positive aspects of life has been linked to improved mood and overall well-being.    - Write down three things you're grateful for each day, or take a few moments to reflect on them. In summary, incorporating exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, stress management, social connections, time spent outdoors, and gratitude practice into your daily life can help increase anti-depression hormones naturally. It is important to find a combination of these strategies that works best for you and maintain consistency in practicing them for long-term benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Friend's hot friend Amber who bartends there hooked it up, even though the guy working the guest list hustled us all for 20 each, since he saw that we just rolled 6 guys deep with no females, even though Amber told us her guest list was free, but oh well, we didn't even have to wait in line and they let us straight up the escalator into the club, so it was all good.  I like the decor and ambiance at this club.  They pay hot women to just chill at the entrance and look sexy.  Drink prices are Vegas standard over here too.  Kind of a journey at first to find the bathroom, but it's there.  I really liked this place cause it wasn't too over crowded and it wasn't too empty.  Plus there's always little Asian kids walking around looking to see if you're in need of some drugs.  That's always a plus for a good night out in Vegas, cause whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas unless you end up with a STD from a casual 1 night stand.  The DJs played a pretty good mix of music the night we went too, mostly hip-hop and some mash-ups.  Not sure what they were doing playing Darude's Sandstorm that night, but that kind of brought back memories of High School Dances.   And if you get kicked out, the bouncers mark giant X's on the back of your hands with a black sharpie so you can't re-enter the club, so have fun scrubbing with that soap in the bathroom if you get booted out and all your friends are still in the club.  And if you get caught making out behind a curtain, chances are you probably might get kicked out like one of my friends did.  Haha!","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed or neutral with a slightly positive leaning.  Step 1: Identify positive aspects - The user mentioned liking the decor and ambiance, not having to wait in line, a good mix of music, and a balanced crowd. They also appreciated the presence of people offering drugs for those interested in partaking. Step 2: Identify negative aspects - The user experienced hustling at the guest list, overpriced drinks, difficulty locating the bathroom, and one of their friends getting kicked out. Step 3: Consider the user's overall experience - While there were a few setbacks (guest list hustling, drink prices), the user still had an overall enjoyable experience, with a good ambiance, music, and crowd. Step 4: Determine sentiment - Taking into account the positive aspects mentioned and the overall experience, the sentiment leans towards slightly positive, but still retains a neutral aspect due to the negative aspects. This makes the sentiment of the review mixed/neutral with a slightly positive leaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece.

Information:  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) is a body of senior uniformed leaders in the United States Department of Defense who advise the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of the \\"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\\" (\\"CJCS\\"), \\"Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\\" (\\"VCJCS\\"), and the Military Service Chiefs from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, all appointed by the President following Senate confirmation. Each of the individual Military Service Chiefs, outside of their Joint Chiefs of Staff obligations, works directly for the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, i.e., Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict.  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing.  - William Joseph ( \`\` Wild Bill '' ) Donovan ( January 1 , 1883 -- February 8 , 1959 ) was a United States soldier , lawyer , intelligence officer and diplomat . Donovan is best remembered as the wartime head of the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency , during World War II. He is also known as the \`\` Father of American Intelligence '' and the \`\` Father of Central Intelligence '' . A decorated veteran of World War I , General Donovan is the only person to have received all four of the United States ' highest awards : The Medal of Honor , the Distinguished Service Cross , the Distinguished Service Medal , and the National Security Medal . He is also a recipient of the Silver Star and Purple Heart , as well as decorations from a number of other nations for his service during both World Wars .  - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.

Step 1: Identify the subject The subject of the review is Metallica and their latest work. Step 2: Analyze the tone and key phrases The user says \\"throwing in the towel\\", which indicates a sense of surrender or giving up, suggesting a negative connotation. However, they also mention \\"20 years of solid heavy metal,\\" which can be seen as a compliment, indicating a positive connotation. Step 3: Evaluate the overall sentiment The reviewer is glad that Metallica stopped before producing something that they consider undesirable, as evidenced by the statement, \\"glad they did it before another reload\\". While this might be seen as a compliment (since they appreciated the band's previous work), it can also be interpreted as a negative statement, as the user does not seem pleased with the potential direction the band could have taken.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What type of instrument did McBurney point out was a haunting sound that punctuated the Kije music? ?  Despite his lack of experience in composing film music, Prokofiev began his Kijé score confidently, later writing: \\"I somehow had no doubts whatever about the musical language for the film\\". He told the producers, \\"What is important to me is the era, the internal meaning of each event, the personality of each hero\\", and warned them not to expect mere musical \\"illustrations\\". He attended rehearsals and made detailed notes of the action and the acting. The period setting of the film appealed to Prokofiev; Robinson comments that the Kijé score is one of several works, including the Classical Symphony, The Love of Three Oranges, Cinderella, and War and Peace, that show \\"the composer's fondness for the eighteenth century\\". The language he chose combined elements of humour and romance with an underlying melancholy—he interpreted the story as more tragic than comic. Prokofiev had heard Ravel's Boléro in Paris, and had been much impressed by the French composer's use of the saxophone, an instrument then rarely used in orchestral compositions outside France but which suited Prokofiev's intentions perfectly. The composer Gerard McBurney has pointed out the \\"haunting sounds of the tenor saxophone\\" that punctuate the Kijé music.The critic Ernest Chapman refers to Prokofiev's \\"unfailingly witty and melodious score\\". It comprises only about 15 minutes of music, written as a series of 16 short fragments or leitmotifs which are repeated at appropriate times during the film's duration, to highlight specific moments in the drama. This approach was a departure in film music from the established form of broad symphonic movements, and was described by Prokofiev's biographer Daniel Jaffé as \\"well ahead of its time ... one of the most celebrated [film scores] of that era\\".

The process of loading and operating a dishwasher is a sequence of physical actions and interactions with the machine. The person's dieting status plays no direct role in how those tasks are performed, since dieting is related to personal food intake and does not influence the mechanics or procedures of operating the dishwasher.  A person may indirectly influence the dishwasher's efficiency if their diet leads them to use certain types of dishes or produce certain types of food waste. For example, someone on a protein-heavy diet may generate more grease, which could potentially cause issues with the dishwasher's cleaning ability. However, the task given does not specify this, so it's fair to say that dieting does not inherently or directly influence any of the steps of the dishwashing process. In summary, the hypothetical perturbation of a person dieting does not directly impact the given process of loading and running a dishwasher. Therefore, the perturbation is that it does not impact any step of the process, unless some indirect and unspecified aspect of the diet is affecting dish cleanliness.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Works from whose later years included the cello Sonata Duo? ?  Temperley writes: \\"After 1855 [Bennett] was spurred by belated honours, and occasional commissions, to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works, though it was too late to recapture his early self-confidence.\\" Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral cantata, The May Queen, Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an Installation Ode for Cambridge University (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata,The Woman of Samaria for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata (The Maid of Orleans, Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting viva voce examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the...

How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in.

Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's.

Continue the following story. At the workplace, Miguel likes a bagel in the morning, but not toast. The","output":"sunrise cast a warm glow over the city as Miguel made his way to the office. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of baked goods from the small cafe down the street. His stomach growled quietly, a reminder that it was time for his favorite breakfast ritual: a delicious, perfectly toasted bagel. Miguel never understood his colleagues' obsession with toast. To him, it was nothing more than a dry, bland canvas for the toppings of the world. On the other hand, bagels offered a more complex flavor and that amazing chewiness that Miguel simply couldn't resist. In his mind, there was nothing better than sinking his teeth into a warm, soft bagel slathered with cream cheese to start the day. Raymond, one of Miguel's coworkers, joined him one day in the break room as he toasted his bagel to just the right golden brown hue. Raymond raised an eyebrow and asked him, \\"Why not toast, Miguel? Don't you get bored of bagels every single day?\\" Miguel smiled as he spread a generous amount of cream cheese over his bagel. \\"It's not about the bagel itself, Raymond. It's the ritual, the comfort, and the way it sets the tone for my day. Besides, there are so many different flavors and combinations to choose from,\\" he explained. Raymond nodded, intrigued by Miguel's perspective. \\"Well, you do have a point. I can see how the routine can be soothing.\\" As they continued their conversation, Miguel couldn't help but reflect on the deeper meaning behind his bagel preference. Sure, it was just a breakfast food, but it carried a sense of familiarity and consistency that he often craved in his hectic life. The morning bagel ritual provided him with an anchor, a moment of solace in the eye of the storm that was his daily routine. Over the following weeks, Miguel started to notice that some of his colleagues had begun to discover the magic of bagels. In the break room, they shared their favorite flavor combinations and toppings, exchanging excited banter as they toasted their breakfast treats. It was fascinating to Miguel how something as simple as a bagel could create a sense of connection and camaraderie among his coworkers. One particular morning, when a fresh batch of bagels arrived in the office, Jasmine, the office manager, provided a surprise spread of different cream cheese flavors and jams for everyone to try. The break room buzzed with chatter as everyone slathered their chosen concoctions onto their preferred bagels, some laughing in delight at their newfound love for the versatile ring-shaped bread. As Miguel stood in the corner observing the lively scene, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. His love for bagels had turned into a small movement within the office, creating memorable moments amongst his coworkers in the process. He realized that what was once merely a personal breakfast choice had now transformed into a shared experience, weaving its way into the fabric of their daily lives. As the weeks went on, Miguel continued to enjoy his bagel-laden mornings with his colleagues. Each bite reminded him of the importance of finding joy in the smallest of details, whether it be a warm, toasted bagel or a heartwarming conversation with a friend. And although toast still made its appearance in the break room, Miguel believed he had shown his coworkers the blissful taste of bagelhood, turning even the most ardent toast lovers into bagel enthusiasts.

Information:  - The Washington Naval Treaty, also known as the Five-Power Treaty, and including the \\"Four-Power Treaty\\" and the \\"Nine-power Treaty\\" was a treaty among the major nations that had won World War I, which agreed to prevent an arms race by limiting naval construction. It was negotiated at the Washington Naval Conference, held in Washington, D.C., from November 1921 to February 1922, and it was signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy. It limited the construction of battleships, battlecruisers and aircraft carriers by the signatories. The numbers of other categories of warships, including cruisers, destroyers and submarines, were not limited by the treaty, but those ships were limited to 10,000 tons displacement.  - Justice was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Liberté class built by the French Navy . She had three sister ships : Liberté , Vérité , and Démocratie . Justice was laid down in April 1903 , launched in October 1904 , and completed in February 1908 , over a year after the revolutionary British battleship HMS Dreadnought made ships like Justice obsolete . She was armed with a main battery of four 305 mm ( 12.0 in ) guns , compared to the ten guns of the same caliber mounted on Dreadnought . After her commissioning , Justice was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet . In September 1909 , she traveled to the United States for the Hudson - Fulton Celebration . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet . She covered troop convoys from North Africa to France in the first days of the war , and spent the rest based at Corfu and Mudros without seeing any action . After the war ended , she participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War , though a mutiny in the French fleet in April 1919 led to the fleet 's withdrawal . Justice was sold for scrapping in 1922 .  - The French colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the \\"first colonial empire\\", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the \\"second colonial empire\\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second empire came to an end after the loss of bitter wars in Vietnam (1955) and Algeria (1962), and peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The French Navy (\\"national navy\\"), informally , is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces. Tracing its roots back to 1624 it is one of the world's oldest naval forces and historically played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire. Since the early foundings, its roles have been defined as maintaining intelligence, protecting populations, preventing crises, intervening wherever necessary to reestablish peace, and dissuading any threats against vital French interests. The Marine nationale consists of four branches: the \\"Force d'Action Navale\\", the \\"Forces Sous-marines\\", the \\"Aéronavale\\" and the \\"Fusiliers Marins\\" (including Commandos Marine). As a blue-water navy the Marine nationale operates a wide range of fighting vessels, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, nuclear-powered submarines, frigates, patrol boats and support ships. The French Navy does not use prefixes of the names of its ships (such as the Royal Navy uses HMS, for instance). Foreign commentators sometimes use the prefixes \\"FS\\" (for \\"French Ship\\") or FNS (for \\"French Navy Ship\\"); these are not official, however.  - The San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site includes the location of the Battle of San Jacinto, and the USS \\"Texas\\". It is located off the Houston Ship Channel in unincorporated Harris County, Texas near the city of Houston. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's , made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as \\"dreadnoughts\\", and earlier battleships became known as \\"pre-dreadnoughts\\". \\"Dreadnought\\"s design had two revolutionary features: an \\"all-big-gun\\" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships was a crucial catalyst in the intensifying naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. With the launch of a single ship, \\"Dreadnought\\", the scales of naval power were reset overnight. As a result, dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, during the lead up to World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships had outclassed \\"Dreadnought\\". These more powerful vessels were known as \\"super-dreadnoughts.\\" Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued to be used throughout World War II. The only surviving dreadnought is , located near the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site.

Background: Wasim Akram (Urdu: wsym khrm; born 3 June 1966) is a former Pakistani first-class cricketer, cricket commentator and television personality. He is acknowledged as one of the greatest bowlers of all time. A left-arm fast bowler who could bowl with significant pace, he represented the Pakistan cricket team in Test cricket and One Day International (ODI) matches. In October 2013, Wasim Akram was the only Pakistani cricketer to be named in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Context: Akram was a significant figure in the 1992 Cricket World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand when Pakistan won the tournament. In the final, against England, his innings of 33 runs off 19 balls pushed Pakistan to a score of 249 runs for 6 wickets. Akram then took the wicket of Ian Botham early on during the English batting innings; and, when brought back into the bowling attack later on, with the ball reverse swinging, he produced a spell of bowling which led to Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis being bowled in successive deliveries in one over. His performances earned him the Man of the Match award for the final. In 1993, Akram took two consecutive 4-wicket hauls against Sri Lanka in Sharjah, in which 7 out of 8 wickets were either LBW or bowled.  In the 1992-1993 Total International Series in South Africa (involving Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa), he took 5 wickets against South Africa and got his 200th wicket in his 143rd match. Akram took 46 wickets in calendar year 1993, his best year ever in ODIs. His average was less than 19, with an economy rate of less than 3.8 runs per over. He took six 4-wicket hauls in 1993, the most by him in any year. In the 1996 Cricket World Cup, Akram missed the quarterfinal match against India which Pakistan lost and went out of the World Cup. Wasim's great career was often tainted by controversy, not least in the Caribbean in April 1993, his maiden tour as Pakistan's captain. During the team's stop-over in Grenada, he was arrested along with three teammates--Waqar Younis, Aaqib Javed and Mushtaq Ahmed--and two female British tourists; he was charged with possession of marijuana. Between 1994 and 1996, he took 84 wickets in 39 matches.  From January 1992 to December 1997, Akram played 131 matches and took 198 wickets at an average of 21.86, with 14 4-wicket hauls in ODIs. Question: why was he significant? Answer:","output":"Wasim Akram is significant because he was an amazing cricketer, one of the best ever! Imagine this, buddy. You know how in some games, there's a hero who helps his team win? That's what Akram did for his team, many times! In a big tournament in 1992, he hit 33 runs very quickly and got out some very important players from the other team, England. This helped Pakistan win the whole tournament! Also, in a series of games in 1993, he took lots of wickets (that means he got the batsman from the opposing team out). In fact, he did this so well that year that it was his best year for taking wickets! He played many games and was very good at getting players out, but he also faced some problems, like getting in trouble with the police once. But despite these issues, his bowling skills made him a really important player. It's like if you're playing a game, and you have someone who tags everybody else out - that makes them pretty special, right? That's why Wasim Akram is significant!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(Some of the sinking scenes were taken from the 1960 film The Last Voyage and darkened to match the nightly effect.) The next morning, a handful of survivorsâMarshall, his wife Margaret (Howes), and their children Robin and Ben; a young officer named Nick and his love interest Lori; the ship's comic Jackie; and a passenger, Mrs. Morganâare adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby and he's brought aboard, barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it's the ship that attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers him into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost. Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck. Meanwhile, a delirious Ashland hears a mysterious voice speaking to him in German, telling him \\"This ship has been waiting for you...It is your new ship....Your chance has come!\\" The others finally set up in a dusty bunk room, and they separate to retrieve supplies and the injured captain.... My question: What era is the memorabilia from on the vessel? The answer is:","output":"The era of the memorabilia found on the vessel in the movie plot is from the 1930s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.  Question: \\"Who were on opposite sides of the idea to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center?\\" Response: \\"The NSC\\" Options are:  (a). no;  (b). yes; Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"(b). yes; The response correctly answers the question.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about Miss Tennessee? A:","output":"Based on the passage provided, the following can be inferred about Miss Tennessee: 1. She is an animal lover: Miss Tennessee is the one who brought the dog, Steve, home from the shelter. She had been talking about going to the shelter for months, indicating her fondness for animals and a strong desire to adopt a pet.  2. She is compassionate towards animals: She took care to carry Steve in a sweatshirt from the shelter, a sign that she wanted to ensure his comfort and safety. 3. She has a tomboyish charm: Miss Tennessee is described as being full-grown, long-legged, and pretty, but in a tomboyish way. This suggests that she has a balanced mix of feminine and tomboyish qualities, making her unique and attractive in her way. 4. She has a sense of humor: She found it funny to give a dog a man's name, which shows that she enjoys humor and doesn't take things too seriously. The name 'Miss Tennessee' also reflects this quality, as it was used to tease her but also highlighted her attractiveness and charm. 5. She shares a strong bond with her dog, Steve: The passage mentions that Steve absolutely loved Miss Tennessee. He would accompany her when she took a bath, wait for her when she went to places he couldn't, and become anxious when she left him in the car. This indicates that Miss Tennessee had a special bond with her dog and cared for him deeply. 6. She is patient and understanding: When asked for her opinion on Steve, Miss Tennessee sought the narrator's opinion first, showing that she values his thoughts and feelings. In summary, Miss Tennessee is probably a compassionate, charming, and humorous person with a strong bond with her dog, Steve. She displays both feminine and tomboyish qualities, making her an interesting and unique character."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1988, Sub Pop Records LLC was formed by Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in Seattle, Washington. Sub Pop achieved fame in the late 1980s for first signing Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and many other bands from the Seattle alternative rock scene. They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group.  - Jack Endino (born 1964) is an American producer and musician based in Seattle, United States. Long associated with Seattle label Sub Pop and the grunge movement, Endino worked on seminal albums from bands such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and Nirvana. Endino was also the guitarist for the Seattle band Skin Yard which was active between 1985 and 1992. Endino has maintained a down-to-earth and humorous website since 1997, and currently manages a studio in Seattle called Soundhouse Recording.  - Skin Yard was an American grunge band from Seattle, Washington, who were active from 1985 to 1993. The group never gained a mainstream audience, but were an influence on several of their grunge contemporaries, including Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, The Melvins, and Green River.  - Blues rock is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way inspired hard rock, Southern rock, and heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence, with performances and recordings by several popular artists.  - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - Highlights and Lowlives is the eighth studio album by American rock band Blue Cheer , released in 1990 and produced by Jack Endino .  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals.  - \\"Summertime Blues\\" is a song co-written and recorded by American rockabilly artist Eddie Cochran. It was written by Cochran and his manager Jerry Capehart. Originally a single B-side, it was released in August 1958 and peaked at number 8 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 on September 29, 1958 and number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. It has been covered by many artists, including being a number-one hit for country music artist Alan Jackson, and scoring notable hits in versions by The Who and Blue Cheer. Jimi Hendrix performed it in concert.  - Stoner rock or stoner metal is a musical subgenre which combines elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, acid rock, doom metal, and blues rock. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \\"stoner rock\\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \\"desert rock.\\" Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \\"retro\\" production. The genre emerged during the early-1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep.  - Soundgarden is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. Matt Cameron became the band's full-time drummer in 1986, while bassist Ben Shepherd became a permanent replacement for Yamamoto in 1990.  - Blue Cheer was an American rock band that initially performed and recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was sporadically active until 2009. Based in San Francisco, Blue Cheer played in a psychedelic blues rock style, and are also credited as being some of the earliest pioneers of heavy metal, with their cover of \\"Summertime Blues\\" sometimes cited as the first in the genre. They have also been noted as influential in the development of genres as disparate as punk rock, stoner rock, doom metal, experimental rock, and grunge.  - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented.

While the traditional adai is a staple in many households, experimenting with different ingredients and cooking methods can result in unique and exciting flavors to please the palates of both connoisseurs and casual food lovers alike. In this article, we will discuss the basic steps to create a delicious adai and explore the possibilities of enhancing this classic dish by incorporating various ingredients. Step 1: Heat the cooking oil Begin by heating a teaspoon of cooking oil in a frying pan. The choice of oil can help set the base of the dish's flavor profile. Common options include coconut oil for a rich, tropical essence, or vegetable oil for a more neutral taste. Be sure to heat the oil evenly over a medium flame, as this will ensure that the adai cooks evenly without burning or becoming too greasy. Step 2: Pour the batter Once the oil has heated, pour a ladle of batter into the frying pan. The batter should be a mixture of ground rice, legumes, and a selection of aromatic spices such as cumin, black pepper, and red chili. Water should be added to this mixture until a smooth and slightly thick consistency is reached. Pouring the batter evenly will help create a perfectly round adai that is neither too thick nor too thin. Step 3: Flip, cook, and achieve the golden brown perfection Allow the adai to cook for a few moments until its surface appears to be slightly crispy and the edges have turned golden brown. At this point, carefully flip the pancake using a spatula. Continue cooking until the other side of the adai turns golden brown as well. This crucial step will ensure that the pancake is thoroughly cooked, with a deliciously crunchy outer layer that contrasts with its soft and tender interior. Step 4: Experiment with a variety of ingredients The true charm of adai lies in its versatility, which invites creativity and innovation in the kitchen. By experimenting with different types of rice and legumes, incorporating new spices, or adding unique and unexpected ingredients such as grated vegetables, nuts, and seeds, you can create endless varieties of adai tailored to specific tastes and preferences. A popular variation, for example, is the inclusion of chopped onions and grated coconut to create a wonderful blend of flavors and textures. Conclusion In a world of ever-evolving culinary trends, the time-tested adai stands out as a delectable and versatile classic that can be easily customized to suit a wide array of tastes and preferences. By following these basic steps and exploring the many exciting directions this dish can be taken, both new and experienced chefs will find the joys of adai to be a delightful and satisfying addition to their culinary repertoire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bowden's","output":"Title: The Great Bowden Escape Step 1: Establish the Main Characters The story revolves around Bowden, a highly regarded scientist, who learns about a secret government project which he is vehemently opposed to. His close friends and colleagues, Emily and Michael, are determined to help him escape the clutches of the higher-ups involved in the project. The antagonist is a government agent, Douglas, who is tasked with bringing Bowden into compliance with the government's demands. Step 2: Establish the Setting The story is set in the near future, where the lines between scientific advancement and ethical boundaries are blurred. Most of the events take place within a small, secluded house on the outskirts of a bustling city. Step 3: Develop the Inciting Incident While working on a top-secret government project, Bowden uncovers the true intentions and consequences of the project - an advanced mind-controlling weapon with potentially disastrous consequences. Unfortunately, his tracks are traced, and the government officials send Agent Douglas to persuade Bowden to continue his work in silence. Step 4: Build the Main Conflict  In an attempt to protect Bowden and prevent the completion of the mind-controlling weapon, Emily and Michael devise a plan to fake Bowden's departure. Unbeknownst to the government officials, they are hiding him in a secret panic room within the house. With limited time and resources, they work to dismantle the project and expose the government's dark intentions to the public. Step 5: Create a Subplot As Emily, Michael, and Bowden work towards their goal, a low-level government employee, Jenny, becomes suspicious of their activities. She begins secretly investigating them and eventually joins their cause, proving to be instrumental in their efforts to bring this information to the public. Step 6: Introduce Obstacles and Rising Tension Agent Douglas and his team find it increasingly difficult to believe that Bowden has genuinely left. As suspicion grows, the pressure on Emily, Michael, and Bowden mounts. Their efforts to expose the truth are impeded by technological challenges, government surveillance, and paranoia. Trust is tested, and secret alliances are formed. Step 7: Reach the Climax With the government closing in on the house, Emily, Michael, Bowden, and Jenny devise a plan to transmit their findings to the media. They face a heated confrontation with Agent Douglas, resulting in a high-stakes standoff. Bowden remotely triggers a data release that reveals the truth to the world. Step 8: Resolution  The public outcry forces the government to shut down the mind-controlling project for good. While Emily, Michael, and Jenny face repercussions for their actions, Bowden is given a reduced sentence due to his cooperation, and Agent Douglas is reassigned. The final scene shows Bowden reunited with Emily and Michael, ready to embark upon a new, ethical scientific endeavor. In conclusion, The Great Bowden Escape revolves around the main character, Bowden, for whom his friends fake a departure and hide him in a house to protect him and stop an unethical government project. Incorporating elements of friendship, tension, and high stakes, the movie concludes with the protagonists securing a thrilling victory against the antagonist, exposing the truth, and steering the world away from a potentially disastrous scenario."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, the two questions are paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about the purpose and function of the World Trade Center. I will provide a detailed answer below. The World Trade Center (WTC) was a complex of buildings located in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The original complex was completed in 1973 and was primarily designed for commercial purposes. Its primary function was to facilitate international trade and commerce, connecting businesses worldwide. The buildings were famous for their iconic Twin Towers, which were among the tallest in the world until their destruction in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The New World Trade Center complex has since been rebuilt, with One World Trade Center as the main building. The WTC served multiple purposes, which can be categorized as follows: 1. Office space: The WTC provided expansive office spaces for various businesses, accommodating both domestic and international companies. The Twin Towers alone had approximately 10 million square feet of rentable office space. Many prominent financial institutions, including banks, investment firms, and insurance companies had offices in the complex. 2. Trade and commerce: As a hub for international trade, the WTC had multiple dedicated spaces for exhibitions, conferences, and events related to global business. The United States Customs Service also had its New York office in the WTC complex, further highlighting its role in trade. 3. Transportation: The WTC housed the World Trade Center PATH station (Port Authority Trans-Hudson), a major public transit hub that connected New York City to New Jersey. Serving thousands of passengers daily, the PATH station was an essential part of the complex, facilitating easy access for commuters and visitors. 4. Tourism: The observation decks on the 107th floor of the North and South towers provided breathtaking views of New York City and its surroundings. These observation decks were popular tourist attractions, drawing millions of visitors each year. 5. Retail and dining: The World Trade Center complex featured an underground shopping mall called the Mall at the World Trade Center. The mall provided an array of shopping and dining options for people working in and visiting the complex. 6. Art and culture: The WTC housed many pieces of artwork, including sculptures, paintings, and tapestries. Prominent artists such as Alexander Calder and Joan Miró had works displayed in the complex, reflecting the cultural importance of the location. In conclusion, the World Trade Center served as a hub for international commerce and trade, while also providing office spaces, retail and dining options, transportation facilities, and tourist attractions. The complex was a symbol of global economic connectivity and an important part of New York City's infrastructure. The newly rebuilt World Trade Center continues to fulfill many of these functions today."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

We know that team P has 20 engineers and can complete the task in 32 days, while team Q has 16 engineers and can complete the task in 30 days. To find the working capacity of one engineer from each team, we can follow these steps: 1. Determine the work completed by each team per day. - Team P: work completed per day = 1/32 (since they complete the task in 32 days) - Team Q: work completed per day = 1/30 (since they complete the task in 30 days) 2. Determine the work completed by one engineer from each team per day. - Team P: work completed by one engineer per day = (1/32) / 20 = 1/640 - Team Q: work completed by one engineer per day = (1/30) / 16 = 1/480 3. Find the ratio between the working capacities of one engineer from each team. - Ratio: (1/640) : (1/480) To simplify the ratio, let's first find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators: LCM(640, 480) = 3,840 Now, we can express both working capacities with the same denominator: - Team P: (6/3840) - Team Q: (8/3840) Now, we have the simplified ratio: - Ratio: 6:8 - Further simplification gives us: 3:4. However, it should be noted that this is not one of the given answer choices.

First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'Superman' serials, this low budget feature was made and released to theaters, marking George Reeves' and Phyllis Coates' initial appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is re-used in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow Earth' allowing the 'Mole-Men' to come to the surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot). Second, unlike most SF invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes. No 'mild mannered reporter' here! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and self-assertive, grabs control of the situation throughout (\\"I'll handle this!\\"), even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a Mole-Man! As Superman, he is gentler than Clark towards the feisty Lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as \\"Nazi storm troopers.\\"  Third, you will notice that the transition from the Fleisher-like cartoon animated flying of Superman in the two serials to the 'live action' flying in the 'Adventures of Superman' had not yet been made.

I originally booked for a two queen terrace suite 4 months in advance and we checked in two hours prior to 'Check in time'.    We were told we would get notified via text when the room was available - never happened.  We went to the front desk for a second time to a more helpful person and they gave us a one-bedroom suite - which we were told was an \\"upgrade\\".  We needed two beds and we were told that we could get a two queen terrace suite the next day.  We asked for the sofa bed to be made that evening around midnight when we would be gone and they confirmed it would be assembled upon our return back to the room.  This was never done, so 2 people had to sleep on an uncomfortable sofa bed.  The next morning I did call to express my disappointment, and they came to make the sofa bed at 12:00 (noon time).  We asked for the two queen terrace suite (we called early around 9 am) and we were met with resistance from the front desk.

In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer.  - Kym Mazelle (born Kymberly Grigsby; August 10, 1960) is an American singer.

Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles, Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark  all of which developed their own regional scenes.

It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\\".  - Lovefreekz is the alias of British House music producer / remixer Mark Hadfield .

Jessie doesn't enjoy wearing her ring as much as her necklace because the","output":"ring feels heavy and cumbersome on her finger, while the necklace feels almost weightless around her neck. Ever since she was a child, she had been enamored by the mesmerizing pendant that dangled from the delicate silver chain. It featured an intricately carved dragonfly with glittering emerald eyes, a gift from her late grandmother, whom she remembered with immense fondness. The ring, on the other hand, was something she had acquired later in life. It bore an intricately sculpted rose, crafted with skill and detail that could only be found in the work of master jewelers. Each petal was infused with varying shades of deep red, giving the rose a lifelike appearance. The ring was a gift from her fiancé, Richard, and symbolized their love and commitment to one another. Although it held great sentimental value, Jessie couldn't help but feel weighed down by the ring's physical presence on her finger. She often found herself absentmindedly fidgeting with the ring, turning it around her finger or tapping it against nearby surfaces, much to the annoyance of her friends and co-workers. The constant reminder of the ring's presence on her finger only seemed to heighten her awareness of its weight and discomfort. One day, as she was walking through the park to clear her mind, she stumbled upon an elderly woman feeding birds by the pond. The woman had a kind, knowing smile and gentle eyes that twinkled with an air of mischief. Drawn to her, Jessie decided to approach her and strike up a conversation. As they spoke about life and love, Jessie found herself pouring her heart out about her struggles with the ring. To her surprise, the elderly woman chuckled softly and reached into her knit bag to pull out a long string of what appeared to be enchanting, iridescent crystals. \\"My dear,\\" she began, \\"I understand your plight. Sometimes, all we need are options to help us feel more at ease with our decisions.\\" With that, the old woman handed Jessie the shimmering string of crystals. Jessie was mesmerized by the beauty of them and was grateful for the gift. However, she was unsure of how they could help her situation. The elderly woman then guided Jessie through the process of removing the heavy stone from her ring, revealing a tiny secret compartment built into the band. Together, they placed the iridescent crystals inside, sealing it securely. In an instant, the ring's weight seemed to vanish, and it now rested lightly upon her finger. \\"In the past, they believed that carrying the weight of a ring with a hidden crystal could protect and empower the wearer. People would choose the crystals based on their properties and needs,\\" the woman explained. \\"These crystals will help you feel more connected and comfortable with your ring, while still honoring the love it represents.\\" Jessie gazed at the transformed ring, her heart swelling with gratitude for the stranger's thoughtful gift and the newfound sense of peace she now felt. In the days that followed, Jessie found herself feeling more connected to the ring and its symbolic meaning. She continued to wear her beloved dragonfly necklace, but now she felt the same kinship toward the rose ring that she had always appreciated about the pendant. The kindness of the elderly woman and the enchanting crystals had not only shifted her feelings about the ring but also reminded her that sometimes, the greatest burdens could be alleviated through new perspectives, creative solutions, and the wisdom of connected souls."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: One reaction to all the concern about tropical deforestation  is a blank stare that asks the question, \\"Since I don't live there, what does it have to do with me?\\" The answer is that your way of life, wherever you live in the world, is tied to the tropics in many ways. If you live in a house, wash your hair, eat fruits and vegetables, drink soda, or drive a car, you can be certain that you are affected by the loss of tropical forests. Biologically, we are losing the richest regions on earth when, each minute, a piece of tropical forest, the size of ten city blocks, disappears. As many as five million species of plants, animals, and insects (40 to 50 percent of all living things) live there, and are being lost faster than they can be found and described. Their loss is immeasurable. Take rubber for example. For many uses, only natural rubber from trees will do. _ are not good enough. Today over half the world's commercial rubber is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, while the Amazon's rubber industry produces much of the world's four million tons. And rubber is an important material in making gloves, balloons, footwear and many sporting goods. Thousands of other tropical plants are valuable for their industrial use. Many scientists strongly believe that deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect -- or heating of the earth from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As we destroy forests, we lose their ability to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. Carbon dioxide levels could double within the next half-century, warming the earth by as much as 4.5 degrees. The result? A partial melt-down of polar ice caps, raising sea levels as much as 24 feet; even 15 feet could threaten anyone living within 35 miles of the coast. Unbelievable? Maybe. But scientists warn that by the time we realise the severe effects of tropical deforestation, it will be 20 years too late. Can tropical deforestation affect our everyday lives?

Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries? Options: - not enough information - they will have an increased risk of disease - they will enjoy their food more - they will be healthier than those who don't The answer is:","output":"they will have an increased risk of disease"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rinse quinoa in a fine mesh sieve until water runs clear, drain and transfer to a medium pot. Add 2 cups water and salt and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium low and simmer until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside off the heat for 5 minutes; uncover and fluff with a fork. This method (option a) is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of making quinoa for several reasons: 1. Rinsing the quinoa: Using a fine mesh sieve is a practical way to rinse quinoa, as it ensures that the small grains won't fall through the sieve while still allowing water to pass through and remove any debris or residue. Rinsing the quinoa until the water runs clear ensures that the quinoa is thoroughly cleaned, as it may have a natural coating, called saponin, that can make the cooked quinoa taste bitter. 2. Cooking the quinoa: Adding 2 cups of water and salt to the quinoa in a medium pot provides the right ratio for cooking (1 part quinoa to 2 parts water) and enhances the flavor. Bringing this mixture to a boil and then covering the pot and reducing the heat to medium low helps to cook the quinoa evenly. Simmering the quinoa for 15 to 20 minutes is a suitable cooking time, as it allows the quinoa to absorb the water without overcooking. 3. Finishing the quinoa: Letting the cooked quinoa sit off the heat for 5 minutes helps the grains to steam, giving them a more tender and fluffy texture. Uncovering the pot and fluffing the quinoa with a fork after this time assists in separating the grains and prevents a sticky or clumpy result. On the other hand, option b includes a typo (“sleeve” instead of \\"sieve\\") and then repeats the exact same process as option a.

Article: How could I turn down an opportunity for a weeklong cruise on a luxury motorsailer in the Andaman Sea? Without a second thought, I packed my bags and jumped on a plane to Singapore, and the following day I found myself looking out the airplane window at the beautiful waters surrounding the island of Langkawi off the coast of Malaysia. The last time I was in Langkawi was in 2001, when it was relatively quiet. Langkawi has come a long way since then; there are 4, 5, and even 6-star hotels, as well as spas, golfing, horseback riding and even a cable car taking visitors to the highest point on the island. At the Langkawi International Airport I met my shipmates and we were driven to Pantai Tengah with a quick pit stop for sunblock and duty-free goodies. Many other shopping opportunities abound since Langkawi was designated as a duty-free zone in 1987 to entice tourists to the island. A luxurious yacht tender picked us up. Phillipe, the first mate, maneuvered the tender between sailboats and as we went around a small island there she was, S/V Blue Gold. This majestic 10-passenger sailboat--all 165 feet of her--had been built in Italy and recently underwent a full retrofit. Once aboard, the crew welcomed us with refreshments and big smiles. Before we got too comfortable and settled into the plush comforts of the boat, Alain, the captain, took us on a tour of Blue Gold's impressive accommodations. The master suite had a king-size bed, with a lounge area and \\"his & hers\\" wardrobes. The VIP cabin had a queen-size bed, also with a lounge area. Both had ensuite bathrooms. The first evening aboard was the perfect start to our voyage--a small cocktail party followed by a light meal of seared tuna salad. It was exactly what our jet-lagged bodies craved, and we all slept very well aboard what would become our new home for the next 7 days. In the morning after breakfast, we sailed to Pulau Ta Ngah (also spelled \\"Pulau Tengah\\"; pulau means island in Malay). In the 1970s the site had been a Vietnamese refugee transit camp. Not...

If the answer can be found in the passage, label it as \\"span\\". If the answer is a number, label as \\"number\\". Similarly, label \\"date\\" if you think the answer to the given question is a date. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Passage: The 1970s saw a number of new models added to the Buick lineup including the Estate Wagon as its own model in 1970, Buick Centurion in 1971, Buick Apollo in 1973, and Buick Skyhawk in 1975.  1975 also saw the first appearance of the \\"Buick Park Avenue\\" nameplate for Buick as a trim/option package on the Electra 225 Limited.  A Buick Century paced the Indianapolis 500 race not once but twice in the mid 1970s.  For 1976, Buick began selling rebadged Isuzu Geminis as Opels to replace the Opel Kadett models it had previously marketed.  The following year, Electra 225 and LeSabre were redesigned and downsized and the Buick brand saw its best model year sales to date with 773,313 vehicles sold.  1978 marked Buicks 75th anniversary and welcomed a redesigned Century as well as a redesigned Regal coupe which was now available with a turbocharged Buick V6 engine engine.  Buick model year sales broke another record in 1978 with 795,316 vehicles sold.  For 1979, the Riviera was redesigned; Riviera S-Type was named Motor Trend Car of the Year. Question: When was the Electra 225 and LeSabre  redesigned and downsized? Student:","output":"Part 1: Annotating the answer type to a given question that involves complex reasoning. Usage: This task requires us to determine the answer type for a question based on a passage. In this case, the question is \\"When was the Electra 225 and LeSabre redesigned and downsized?\\" Our goal is to identify if the answer type is a span, a number, or a date. Part 2: The answer type is a \\"span\\" if the answer can be found in the passage. Usage: If the answer to the question can be directly extracted from the passage, we would label it as \\"span.\\" However, in this case, the question asks for a date, not a specific phrase or text from the passage. So this part does not apply. Part 3: The answer type is a \\"number\\" if the answer is a number. Usage: If the answer to the question is a number, we would label it as \\"number.\\" In this case, the passage contains a few years (e.g., \\"1970,\\" \\"1971,\\" \\"1973,\\" \\"1975,\\" etc.). However, the question is asking for a specific time when a particular event occurred (redesigning of Electra 225 and LeSabre), so the answer type is not just a number.

Usage: The question \\"When was the Electra 225 and LeSabre redesigned and downsized?\\" requires us to determine a date when these models were redesigned and downsized. Based on the passage, we can see that \\"The following year, Electra 225 and LeSabre were redesigned and downsized.\\" Given that this information follows a sentence mentioning \\"1976\\", the \\"following year\\" would be 1977.

What is the best way to: What is a good way to save money and eat healthier?","output":"To accomplish the task of saving money and eating healthier, a step by step approach would be appropriate and the justifications for each step are also outlined: 1. **Planning out meals:** Prior to shopping for groceries, plan out your meals for the week. This means deciding what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily. By doing so, you'll know exactly what ingredients you need for your meals, which can help you avoid purchasing unnecessary items.     >Justification: Planning ahead provides control over what you eat and also avoids last-minute unhealthy food choices. It can also reduce waste by ensuring that you only buy what you will use. 2. **Creating a detailed shopping list:** After planning your meals, create a detailed list of all the ingredients needed. This will help make sure that everything needed for homemade, healthy meals is on hand.     >Justification: A detailed shopping list keeps you focused and on-task, reducing the chance of impulse buys or unnecessary purchases. 3. **Cooking at home:** Rather than eating out or ordering fast food, aim to cook more meals at home. It's often healthier and less expensive.     >Justification: Preparing your own meals allows you to control the ingredients and portion sizes, and it is typically much cheaper per serving than restaurant meals or pre-made meals at the grocery store. 4. **Buying fruits and vegetables that are in season:** Seasonal produce is often cheaper and fresher, which can help you save money and eat something that is healthier.     >Justification: Fruits and vegetables in season are loaded with nutrients and flavor. Plus, they cost less because they are more abundantly available. 5. **Batch cooking and freezing:** Cook large quantities and freeze individual meals. This approach can save both time and money since buying in bulk is often cheaper.     >Justification: This method reduces the risk of you turning to expensive, less healthy options when you do not have time to cook. 6. **Avoid buying processed foods:** Processed foods often come with a higher price tag and are not as healthy as wholesome, fresh foods.     >Justification: Processed foods often contain high levels of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats, as well as preservatives. By avoiding these foods, you can improve your health and potentially save money. 7. **Drinking water instead of sugary drinks:** It's not only a healthier choice, but also a money-saving move.     >Justification: Sugary drinks contribute to weight gain and other health issues, and they're also an added expense. Water is virtually free and has zero calories. Executing these steps effectively would help you in saving money and eating healthier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is one of only two ships of the United States to be named after a monarch. She was later reclassified as an attack submarine and redesignated SSN-642. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true?

In fact, the paragraph states that USS Kamehameha (SSBN-642) was a \\"Benjamin Franklin\\"-class ballistic missile submarine. The SSBN classification itself implies that it was specifically designed to carry ballistic missiles. The \\"Benjamin Franklin\\"-class submarines were developed during the Cold War and were equipped with ballistic missiles as their primary armament. These submarines were designed as part of the United States' nuclear deterrent strategy, carrying missiles with nuclear warheads that could be launched at targets across the globe if needed. Initially, they were equipped with Polaris missiles and later transitioned to the Poseidon missile system in the late 1960s. Later, the USS Kamehameha was reclassified as an attack submarine and redesignated as SSN-642, which can give a hint that it might have undergone some changes in its armament configuration. However, even though the focus of its mission shifted more towards its attack capabilities, it is incorrect to conclude that the submarine did not house missiles at any point in its service. Instead, we could infer that during its time as a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN-642), it did carry ballistic missiles, and later as an attack submarine (SSN-642), it might have carried different types of armament, such as cruise missiles, torpedoes, or mines. In summary, it would be incorrect to claim that the submarine did not house missiles based on the paragraph provided.

Given the question: Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are Bigger or Smaller ):  The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be.   John was watching the ocean from the beach and after a long period of observation, he concluded that the less wind there is, that the waves will become Bigger or Smaller? The answer is:","output":"To determine the answer to this question, let's break down the information given in the passage step by step. Step 1: Understand the main factors affecting the size of ocean waves The passage states that three factors determine the size of ocean waves: the speed of the wind, the distance the wind blows, and the duration the wind blows. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the factors and the size of the waves The passage tells us that \\"The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be\\". This means that if any of these factors increase, the size of the wave will also increase. Step 3: Apply the given information to John's observation John observed the ocean for a long period and made a conclusion about the relationship between wind and wave size. The question asks what will happen to the wave size if there is less wind. Step 4: Compare the factors and make a conclusion If there is less wind, it means the speed of the wind is lower. Referring back to the passage, we understand that a greater wind speed contributes to a bigger wave size. Thus, when the wind speed is lower (less wind), the wave size will be smaller. So, the answer is: Smaller."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Possible answers:  1). yes  2). it is not possible to tell  3). no","output":"The given premise is \\"Miss Universe contest.\\" Based on this premise, we can analyze whether it entails the hypothesis \\"There is a Miss Universe contest.\\" To make this analysis, we should first understand the meaning of entailment in the context of logic and reasoning. Entailment refers to a relationship between statements where the truth of one statement necessarily implies the truth of another statement. In other words, if a statement A is true, then statement B must be true as well. This is also known as logical consequence or logical implication. Now, let's examine the given premise and hypothesis. The premise is \\"Miss Universe contest,\\" which refers to the existence of a beauty pageant called Miss Universe. The hypothesis is \\"There is a Miss Universe contest,\\" which is essentially stating the same thing with the existence and acknowledgment of such a competition. With these definitions in mind, we can analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the premise is true and there is a Miss Universe contest, then it would automatically imply that the hypothesis stating \\"There is a Miss Universe contest\\" is also true. Consequently, the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis.

In late February one bitcoin was worth Â£22 (33) but now each one sells for about Â£60 (90). Thieves who run networks of hijacked PCs are increasingly using these machines to create or \\"mine\\" the coins. But bitcoin miners say thieves will struggle to keep up, as coin-generating technology becomes more sophisticated. As a virtual currency, bitcoins depend on a wide network of closely connected computers to log who holds the coins and where they are spent. That network also shares information about who is \\"mining\\" the coins. Mining involves solving a hard mathematical problem and miners typically use large numbers of computers to speed up the number crunching involved. \\"Botnet mining is fundamentally theft of private property, illegal and unethical,\\" Jeff Garzik, a bitcoin developer told the BBC, adding that bitcoin miners had battled botnets for years, seeing them as a \\"cost and a burden\\" they just had to deal with. Many cyber-thieves who control botnets, large networks of home PCs compromised with a virus, were using them as a dedicated mining pool in a bid to generate bitcoins for themselves, said Derek Manky, senior security strategist at Fortinet. The operators of one of the biggest current botnets, known as ZeroAccess, had recently ramped up their efforts to use machines they control to mine bitcoins, he said, adding that millions of infected PCs were unwittingly enrolled in the criminal network. \\"ZeroAccess has employed an affiliate model,\\" he said. \\"They pay other people to install malware for them.\\" The operators of ZeroAccess were making so much money that they were paying high prices for each infection. Current rates ran at about 100 (Â£65) for every 1,000 infections, said Mr Manky. As well as mining bitcoins, PCs enrolled in ZeroAccess were also being used to poison search results - to cause users to unwittingly click on booby-trapped web pages - or fraudulently click on adverts to generate revenue. \\"ZeroAccess has been extremely profitable,\\" said Mr Manky. The wider bitcoin community was aware of the efforts botnet owners were making to produce their own cash, said Mr Manky. \\"They try to detect and remove these transactions but it's a bit of a cat and mouse game,\\" he said. \\"The operators of ZeroAccess know about that and just change their tactics.\\" However, said Mr Garzik, criminal participation in bitcoin mining was likely to get much less profitable as professional miners turned away from using desktop PCs to generate the coins. Increasingly, he said, professional miners were using custom-made chips, called Asics (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), to mine because such processors worked faster. \\"It is theorised that the current shift in bitcoin mining to 'Asic' miners - the fastest and most advanced generation - will simply make it unprofitable for botnet miners,\\" said Mr Garzik. Vitalik Buterin, technical editor at Bitcoin Magazine, said the the rise of Asic mining meant cyber-thieves would soon be pushed out. Currently, he said, only about one-third of all professional miners were using Asics, but as that proportion grew, the number of bitcoins that could be generated with a botnet would shrink. \\"The fact that botnets are (somewhat) viable now is basically an aberration resulting from the massive price increase that has not yet been matched by increased mining activity,\\" he said. \\" Once Bitcoin stabilises again the botnets will rapidly crawl back into the shadows.\\"","output":"This article explains that cyber thieves are using hijacked computer networks to create or \\"mine\\" bitcoins, but as bitcoin mining technology becomes more sophisticated, it will be harder for them to keep up."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The War of the Limburg Succession, was a series of conflicts between 1283 and 1289 for the succession in the Duchy of Limburg. The cause of the War of the Limburg Succession was the death of Waleran IV, Duke of Limburg in 1280, and his only daughter Ermengarde of Limburg in 1283. Waleran IV had no sons and Ermengarde had no children. Ermergarde had married Reginald I of Guelders, who now claimed the Duchy of Limburg. However, Waleran's nephew Adolf VIII of Berg, son of his elder brother Adolf VII of Berg, also claimed the Duchy. Unable to assert his claims, he sold them in 1283 to the mighty John I, Duke of Brabant. Between 1283 and 1288, several smaller confrontations occurred between both sides, none of them decisive. Meanwhile, most of the other local powers chose sides. Siegfried II of Westerburg, the Archishop of Cologne and ruler of the Electorate of Cologne, traditional enemy of the Duke of Brabant, forged an alliance with Reginald I, joined by Henry VI, Count of Luxembourg, and his brother Waleran I of Luxembourg, Lord of Ligny, as well as by Adolf, King of Germany. On the other side the Counts of Mark took the chance to affirm their independence from the Archbishop of Cologne and together with the Counts of Loon, Tecklenburg, and Waldeck allied with Brabant and Berg. The citizens of the City of Cologne, eager to emancipate themselves from the Archbishop's rule, also joined this alliance. After the decisive Battle of Worringen in 1288, won by Duke John I of Brabant and his allies, the Duchy of Limburg came in the possession of the Duke of Brabant. The City of Cologne gained its independence from the Archbishopric and finally the status of an Imperial city in 1475. How many years did the conflict between Adolf VIII and the Duke of Brabant last?","output":"To determine the number of years the conflict between Adolf VIII and the Duke of Brabant lasted, let's examine the key dates mentioned in the text: 1. 1283: Adolf VIII of Berg sold his claims to the Duchy of Limburg to John I, Duke of Brabant. 2. 1288: The decisive Battle of Worringen took place, sealing the victory for the Duke of Brabant and his allies.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What can cause someone to want to go somewhere else because it's so smelly? Possible A: rose bush, go back, die, arrive there, fart  Why is \\"fart\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Fart\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because the question pertains to unpleasant smells causing someone to want to leave a particular location. When we interpret the question more deeply, it is evident that it asks why a particular place would smell so bad that it compels individuals to exit. Hence, we are looking for an answer associated with producing an unpleasant smell that can potentially disrupt individuals present in the surrounding vicinity.  Among the options provided, \\"fart\\" aligns with the context of the question. According to human common sense and everyday experiences, a fart, which is the release of gas from the digestive system through the rectum, can produce a foul smell. It's a natural process and everybody does it; however, it can be embarrassing and uncomfortable for others in closed environments because of the associated smell. This can lead to discomfort and, as a result, people might wish to leave the place. Therefore, it justifies why someone would want to move to another location. As for the other options: 'rose bush' generally has a pleasant fragrance and would more likely attract people rather than repel them. 'Go back' and 'arrive there' are actions that don't specifically relate to the generation of a smell at all. 'Die' might be associated with the smell of decomposition, but it's macabre and less likely to be considered in a common conversation unless in a very specific context. Thus, \\"fart\\", being associated with an unpleasant smell eliciting a common human reaction of wanting to leave a smelly place, is the most suitable answer amongst the provided options, aligned with everyday human observations and common sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: who assumes office if the president is impeached?","output":"To answer this question, I will look into the procedure of presidential impeachment and what happens when the president is removed from office. Step 1: Understanding Impeachment Impeachment is the process by which a legislative body brings charges against a government official, including the president. In the United States, the House of Representatives is responsible for bringing articles of impeachment, while the Senate conducts the impeachment trial. Step 2: Outcome of Impeachment Trial If the Senate votes to convict the president on any of the articles of impeachment with a two-thirds majority, the president is removed from office. It's important to note that impeachment itself does not automatically remove the president from office; it is merely the formal accusation. Step 3: Order of Succession Following a president's removal from office, the order of succession comes into play. In the United States, the Presidential Succession Act establishes the line of succession for filling the vacancy left by a removed president. Step 4: Identifying the Successor According to the U.S. Presidential Succession Act, the first person in line to assume office if the president is removed from office is the Vice President. In this case, the Vice President would be immediately sworn in as the new President of the United States.

For week four, the Bears donned their 1940s throwbacks when they hosted the 1-2 Packers, the Bears having led the all-time series 93-89-2, but the Packers had won 9 of the previous 11 games. On offense, the Bears' worst-ranked rushing game (64 yards per game) had a chance to produce against the Packers, who were ranked 30th by allowing 156 yards per game, while opponents had run a league-most 37.3 times per game while scoring an also league-high five rushing touchdowns. Also, Matt Forte had recorded 336 yards and four touchdowns against the Packers in his last two games. The offense also was challenged by the pass defense, with defenders Sam Shields and Tramon Williams, who were stingy in man coverage. For the Bears' defense, the Packers had also struggled on the run, ranking 26th in the league with a 78-yard rushing average and the longest run being of 17 yards, while having averaged only 3.63 yards per carry. Additionally, Green Bay was ranked 28th in the league in yards. However, the team faced the Packers' passing attack, which featured the receiving duo of Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb. The former led the league in targets (37) and first downs (16), while ranking second in receiving yards (351), while the Bears had struggled with covering slant and dig routes, both of which Nelson excelled at. The latter had three touchdowns in 2014, but was used primarily for hitch and stick routes. The Packers were two-point favorites. Sherrick McManis, Shea McClellin, Roberto Garza, Matt Slauson, Jared Allen, Charles Leno, Jr., and Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. Kyle Long, Alshon Jeffery, and Ryan Mundy served as team captains for the game, while the honorary captains were Dick Butkus and Kurt Becker. The Packers won the coin toss, and decided to kick. On the first drive, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's six-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, which the Packers responded with Eddie Lacy's two-yard touchdown run. During Chicago's next drive, on 4th and 1, Cutler fumbled the snap, and upon picking up the ball, recorded a 16-yard run on an accidental fumblerooski. The drive continued into the second quarter, ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yard field goal. The two teams exchanged touchdowns on the final three plays: Aaron Rodgers' three-yard pass to Nelson, Cutler's eight-yard pass to Jeffery, and Rodgers' 22-yard pass to Cobb. The Bears reached the Packers' nine-yard line by the final play of the first half; on the play, Cutler's pass for Bennett was ruled short of a touchdown. During the television review, Micah Hyde covered the camera angle, preventing the touchdown and ending the half with the Packers leading 21-17. In the third quarter, the Packers drove to the Bears' 34-yard line, where Rodgers completed a touchdown pass to Davante Adams, which would be nullified by a holding penalty on center Corey Linsley; Crosby would eventually kick a 53-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler's pass for Josh Morgan would be tipped by Williams and intercepted by Clay Matthews, with Green Bay capitalizing on the takeaway with Rodgers' 11-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. On the next drive, Shields intercepted Cutler, and Crosby kicked a 23-yard field goal; however, a holding penalty on Jon Bostic led to Rodgers' three-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. On Chicago's next drive, Williams intercepted Cutler, but the play would be nullified; the Bears would subsequently punt. On the Packers' next drive, they would reach the Bears' 20-yard line before Crosby's field goal was blocked by Willie Young, the first block by the Bears in over a year. Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler on the final drive, and the Bears ran out the clock to end the game. The Bears recorded 496 yards, the first time since 1979 against the Minnesota Vikings that the Bears recorded such yardage and lost. The last time the team recorded more than 496 yards and lost occurred in 1947 against the Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Cardinals. Additionally, the rushing attack recorded 102 yards in the first quarter, the first time Chicago recorded at least 100 rushing yards in the first quarter since 2010 against the Carolina Panthers.

Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morningâstill in the elevatorâhe finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.[1] On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the virgin vault. After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave their rooms and then starts to look for a match. When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as \\"Jane-ites\\", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by Jane Austen. He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the \\"bra matching the panties\\", and Matthew accuses him of being too machismo. Rod introduces Matthew to the \\"penile power\\", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: For Yali Liu, the hardest thing about UK higher education is having to go to the pub. \\"It's how much you need to invest socially with other students,\\" she says. \\"I don't like going to a pub or club, but people just keep going out and I feel the pressure to go out too.\\" This is because, unlike in China, she says, there is so much emphasis during the course on teamwork and group projects, so socialising with other students - especially British people, is crucial. Liu, 23, who is in her final year of a BSc in business administration at the University of Bath, is one of more than 80,000 Chinese students studying in UK universities. They are responsible for a large proportion of the more than PS10bn a year that international students contribute to the UK economy. However, research shows that where their academic attainment  is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China. To find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse. They believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation. Professor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000...

And that's a bad thing, because at least if this had been a Troma film, it would have had wanton violence and a greater sense of anarchic abandon that might have brought my rating up a bit. So what we have instead is a very tame (rated PG), barely lukewarm, low budget (Roger Corman produced it with an unknown director who has subsequently remained unknown) Gremlins (1984)/Critters (1986)-wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor, little of the logic that made Gremlins work so well--fantasy logic or not, no suspense, no sense of adventure, and no violence or nudity to make up for it. Although I'm sure some of the problems with the film are inherent in the script--let's face it, no one could deliver these jokes so that they would be funny--it seems like the biggest blame has to fall into the lap of the director, Bettina Hirsch. In more capable hands, Munchies could have been entertaining. After all, it starts out like many great adventure films. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in Peru on an archaeological dig. Simon is a bit of a wacky archaeologist who is always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations. For example, he thinks he sees evidence of laser-cutting on ancient stonework. So they're at Machu Picchu looking for more evidence of Simon's theories when they happen upon a secret chamber. Inside they quickly find the animal they later dub \\"Arnold\\", one of the titular munchies. They take Arnold back home to their small California desert town. Simon, who thinks that Arnold is probably an alien creature, has to go off to a colleague's lecture, and he plans on telling the colleague that he finally has an alien specimen. Paul and his extremely cute girlfriend, Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde), are left in charge of Arnold, but as they haven't seen each other in a long time, they leave Arnold unsupervised while they hop in the sack. Meanwhile, Simon's brother Cecil (played also by Korman in a dual role), owner of a successful snack foods company, is eager to buy off Simon's home and land--they're adjacent to his own. Simon doesn't want to sell, so Cecil hits upon a scheme to steal Arnold. Things gradually spiral out of control, and the munchies, who have a mean streak to go along with their cravings for junk food, begin to overrun the town. That reads better in a summary than it plays on the screen. The best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background, such as when characters are driving on the outskirts of the desert town. Interiors, with the exception of Cecil's home, tend to look like poorly decorated, cheap sets, and more importantly, they tend to show that Hirsch is not very skilled at blocking and setting up shots. Oddly, given the paucity of the production design overall, Cecil's home is quite a gem, imbued as it is in overblown 1980s style down to the smallest details, and Cecil's stepson, Dude (Jon Stafford), was an amusing counterpoint. Too bad, then, that he's out of the film so quickly. At any rate, Korman is a fun actor, but he comes across much better here as Simon than as Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up being absent for most of the film. Cecil, who is differentiated physically by a ridiculous wig and facial hair, is not only the \\"evil capitalist\\" of the film, he's one of Korman's classic inconsiderate, boorish characters--that was one of his specialties, frequently capitalized on in \\"Carol Burnett Show\\" (1967) skits. Unlike \\"The Carol Burnett Show\\", which tended to succeed because directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a studied way of pushing the skits just to the brink of chaos, Hirsch reins Korman in way too far, and the Cecil character just doesn't work the way it should. There are a lot of other director-related problems, not the least of which is wonky pacing and editing, which completely sap any possible suspense or compelling dramatic impact from the film. Even scenes that should have been shoe-ins for amping up the drama--such as when the munchies are harassing an old lady on the road--are put together far too awkwardly to have much affect. There are also serious logical problems with the story as it stands. Where did the munchie in the chamber at Machu Picchu come from? The film's trailer seems to show an answer to this, but it was edited out of the final cut. A more serious problem is that, unlike gremlins, there is no clear reason for munchies to go from cute, cuddly furballs to menacing monsters. It just happens. Further, because Munchies was kept PG, and the violence remains toned down, when the creatures are in their monster phase, they're never very threatening. They're also easily dispatched, at least temporarily. Admittedly, the gist of the film isn't suspense, horror, compelling drama or any of that other stuff, but humor. It's intended more as a spoof of Gremlins and the countless rip-offs in its wake. The only problem with that is that the film just isn't funny, even though I chuckled a couple times. A surprisingly high percentage of the jokes are bland clichés. Too much of the remaining material consists of non-sequiturs. Given bad timing from Hirsch, it all just falls flat. There was potential to make a film that while a spoof, was both funny and frightening, hilarious and disturbing, cheesy and suspenseful, all at the same time, ala Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988). Too bad, then, that Munchies comes nowhere near that. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Circulatory System Changes Blood volume increases substantially during pregnancy, so that by childbirth, it exceeds its preconception volume by 30 percent, or approximately 1–2 liters. The greater blood volume helps to manage the demands of fetal nourishment and fetal waste removal. In conjunction with increased blood volume, the pulse and blood pressure also rise moderately during pregnancy. As the fetus grows, the uterus compresses underlying pelvic blood vessels, hampering venous return from the legs and pelvic region. As a result, many pregnant women develop varicose veins or hemorrhoids.

In fact, the given premise suggests the opposite. The statement reveals two important actions that Adrin performs, both of which imply discomfort or pain in his shoulder: 1. Adrin winced: Wincing is a facial expression or an involuntary flinch that is generally associated with pain, discomfort, or sudden distress. The fact that Adrin winces suggests that he is experiencing some level of discomfort or pain, which contradicts the hypothesis that he feels no pain in his shoulder. 2. Adrin rolled his shoulder twice: Rolling one's shoulder is a common action people take when attempting to alleviate discomfort, stiffness, or pain in the shoulder area. The fact that Adrin does this twice reinforces the idea that he is experiencing at least some level of discomfort. Considering these actions, it is highly unlikely that Adrin felt no pain in his shoulder. Rather, the premise suggests that he is experiencing some degree of discomfort or pain that prompted him to wince and roll his shoulder. Furthermore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the severity of Adrin's shoulder pain or the cause of his discomfort based on the given premise alone. We would need more information and context to determine factors like the intensity of his pain, the cause of his discomfort (such as an injury, strain, or some other reason), and whether it is a chronic or acute issue.

When we knew it might be his last birthday, the whole family decided to get together for a huge birthday celebration at the nursing home. Dad was a good storyteller and we were always his listeners. During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes. Everyone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many hundreds of people in his life, here was our chance to tell him how much we love him. A few months later, at Dad's memorial service, we more fully realized what we had given to Dad that night. Those are the stories people normally tell at a funeral   after a loved one is no longer alive to hear the words. They tell stories, full of tears. But we had given those memories to Dad in his life, and we had told them through laughter, together with hugs and joy. He had them to hold and enjoyed them from time to time in his mind during his last days and months. Words do matter, and they are enough. We just need to say them or to speak them publicly the ones we love. That's the ways to give back love and that's our chance to celebrate a person in his or her life.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Cream blushes don't have to contain dangerous chemicals. By making your own cream blush, you get to decide exactly what goes into it—and you can customize the color too. This section will teach you how to make your own cream blush. You can apply it using your fingers or makeup sponge. Fill the bottom pot with an inch or two of water and place the upper pot on top. Transfer everything to the stove and turn the stove on to a medium heat. If you do not have a double boiler, then you can make your own by filling a large pot with an inch or two of water, and placing a large bowl over it. The bottom of the bowl should not touch the water. You will need 1 teaspoon of shea butter and ½ teaspoon of emulsifying wax. Place both ingredients into the upper pot or bowl of your double boiler. Heat the two ingredients until they melt. Be sure to stir them while they are melting with a spoon or spatula. This helps the butter and wax melt more evenly, and it mixes them together. Once the shea butter and emulsifying wax have melted completely, turn the stove off and move the double boiler to a heat-resistant surface. The mixture in the pot should look translucent, and there should be no clumps. Once the mixture has cooled slightly, measure out 1 tablespoon of aloe gel and transfer it to the mixture. Blend everything together with a spoon or spatula. Try to use a clear aloe gel, as opposed to a tinted one. Add both your mica and cocoa powders a little bit at a time until you get the color you want. You can use any color of mica powders you want, but pinks and reds might yield the best and most natural results. The cocoa powders will help darken the blush. If you wish to have a lighter blush, then use less cocoa. You will need ½ to 1 teaspoon of each powder, depending on your preferences. Consider dipping a spoon into the mixture, letting it cool, and holding it against your cheek to make sure you have the right color. Once you have achieved the color you want, transfer everything into a small, seal-able jar using a spoon or spatula. Leave the jar in a cool place, unopened, until it has solidified, then seal the jar tightly with a lid. Wait 24 hours before using the blush. This allows it to solidify. You can leave your container as is, or you can personalize it further by adding a personalized label or embellishing it with stick-on gems.","output":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on creating your own chemical-free, customizable cream blush using natural ingredients, a double boiler, and blending mica and cocoa powders for the desired color."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What will Alex want to do next?\\", is \\"keep pinching him\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","output":"No, \\"keep pinching him\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Alex want to do next?\\". The question seeks to understand what actions or decisions Alex might take after the situation mentioned in the statement. The statement \\"Alex felt the pinch but kept on moving forward\\" implies that Alex experienced some discomfort or pain (the pinch) but persevered and continued moving forward despite the adversity. This shows Alex's determination, resilience, and focus on his goal or task at hand. A more valid answer to this question could involve understanding Alex's motivations and the context in which he is operating. For instance, if Alex were in a sports competition and experienced a minor injury yet did not let that stop him, he might want to train harder or seek medical advice to prevent future injuries. In a more metaphorical sense, if \\"the pinch\\" refers to a challenge or setback in Alex's professional life, he might want to analyze the situation, identify areas for improvement, and come up with a strategy to overcome future obstacles. He might also seek support and guidance from colleagues, friends, or mentors. In both scenarios, Alex's focus remains on moving forward and advancing towards his goals.

Ultimately, Avengers: Age of Ultron can't recapture the charm and majesty of seeing Earth's Mightiest Heroes assembled for the first time. That said, it's still a lot of fun and offers plenty of great action and character moments. 2. Joss Whedon sets up the future of the Avengers for the Russo Brothers, but this is no longer exciting. It's exhausting. 3. Sure, this is the A Team of comic book superstars, but overextended sequences don't make them any more impressive. 4. Age of Ultron is a Western about military service: it's a call to arms to protect American values like the family and the home from East European types and electronic threats to security systems. 5.

It seems the two characters are part of a pack of supernatural or magical beings (specifically \\"Lykan\\"). The female is described as being able to keep up with Lucien, who is noted to be extremely fast. Step 2: Introduce a new event in the story As they return to the pack, a brown Lykan female joins them, flanking the other female (the protagonist) on either side. This new character has a more long and languid appearance, along with blue eyes that appear to be laughing as she looks questioningly between the protagonist and Lucien. Step 3: Develop interactions between characters The protagonist will notice the brown Lykan female's gaze and feel compelled to interpret the situation. In turn, she will be curious to understand the relationship between her, Lucien, and the newcomer.

She couldn't help but wonder what the newcomer wanted, or if there was any hidden intention behind her eyes. \\"What's so funny?\\" she inquired, her voice equally curious and assertive. The brown Lykan female tilted her head, her eyes sparkling as she replied, \\"Oh, nothing. I was just admiring the rapport between you two.

As they continued running, Yara began to feel the subtle shift in the pack's dynamics. Ellara's presence added an air of mystery, and she could sense the unspoken questions lingering in the air. It was clear that their journey back to the pack was no ordinary one, and that perhaps, she, Lucien, and Ellara had important roles to play in the future of their pack."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In business, net income (total comprehensive income, net earnings, net profit, informally, bottom line) is an entity's income minus cost of goods sold, expenses and taxes for an accounting period. It is computed as the residual of all revenues and gains over all expenses and losses for the period, and has also been defined as the net increase in shareholders' equity that results from a company's operations. In the context of the presentation of financial statements, the IFRS Foundation defines net income as synonymous with profit and loss. Is it true that is net earning the same as net income?","output":"Yes, net earnings and net income are often used interchangeably in the context of financial performance and financial reporting. Both terms refer to the same financial metric that illustrates a company's profitability after accounting for all its costs, expenses, and taxes over a specific accounting period. To provide a detailed understanding of net income and net earnings, let's break down each component of the formula: 1. Revenues: Also known as sales, revenues represent the amounts a company earns from its primary business activities, such as selling products or services to customers. It is crucial to note that revenue is recognized when the transaction occurs, not necessarily when cash is received. 2. Gains: These are profits from non-operating or secondary activities, such as selling fixed assets or other investments. Gains can be either realized (when the asset is sold) or unrealized (when the asset's market price increases without selling it). Generally, gains are not as common as revenues and are not considered a primary source of income. 3. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): This is the direct cost associated with producing or acquiring the goods or services a company sells. COGS typically includes material costs, labor costs directly tied to production, and manufacturing overhead expenses. 4. Expenses: These are costs incurred during regular business operations that are not directly linked to producing or acquiring goods and services, such as administrative expenses, marketing expenses, salaries, rent, utilities, research and development costs, etc. 5. Taxes: This is the liability a company has towards tax authorities based on its taxable income. Companies often need to estimate their tax liabilities and integrate them into their income statement. 6. Accounting Period: This is the time span covered by the financial statement, typically a fiscal quarter or fiscal year. When you calculate net income or net earnings, you take the total revenues and gains the company has earned during the accounting period and subtract all the costs, expenses, and taxes. The resulting figure demonstrates the company's ability to generate profit from its operations and other activities. In summary, net earnings and net income are essentially the same concept in the realm of financial accounting and reporting. Both terms are used to describe a company's profitability after accounting for all costs, expenses, and taxes during a defined accounting period. Entities may use either term in their financial statements, and investors and analysts often treat them synonymously when assessing a company's financial performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Mohács in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz. The Ottomans lost much of their European possessions, with Podolia  returned to Poland. Question: What happened first, the second Battle of Mohács or the Battle of Zenta? Answer:","output":"The second Battle of Mohács happened first. The second Battle of Mohács took place in 1687, while the Battle of Zenta occurred a decade later, in 1697."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What do Arkham's inhabitants do to the warlock? , can you please find it?   In 1765, the inhabitants of Arkham, Massachusetts, are suspicious of the strange phenomena surrounding the grand \\"palace\\" that overlooks the town. They suspect the palace's owner, Joseph Curwen, is a warlock. A young girl wanders up to the palace in a trance-like state. She is led by Curwen and his mistress, Hester, down into the dungeons. The girl is subjected to a strange ritual, in which an unseen creature rises up from a covered pit. The townspeople observe the girl wandering off, and they storm the palace to confront its owner. Though the girl appears unharmed, the townspeople surmise that she has been bewitched to forget what happened to her. They drag Curwen out to a tree where they intend to burn him. The mob leader, Ezra Weeden, insists that they do not harm Hester (to whom he had been previously engaged to marry). Before being burned alive, Curwen puts a curse on Arkham and its inhabitants and their descendants, promising to rise from the grave to take his revenge. In 1875, 110 years later, Curwen's great-great-grandson, Charles Dexter Ward, and his wife Anne arrive in Arkham after inheriting the palace. They find the townsfolk hostile towards them and are disturbed by the horrific deformities that afflict many of Arkham's inhabitants. Charles is surprised by how well he seems to know the palace and struck by his strong resemblance to a portrait of Curwen. He and Anne meet Simon, the palace caretaker, who persuades them to stay at the palace and to forget the townspeoples' hostility. Charles becomes more and more obsessed with the portrait of Curwen, and at times seems to change in his personality. The answer is:","output":"The inhabitants of Arkham suspect Joseph Curwen of being a warlock due to the strange phenomena surrounding his palace.

Information:  - The Swedish Empire refers to the Kingdom of Sweden's territorial control of much of the Baltic region during the 17th and early 18th centuries, a time when Sweden was one of the great European powers. The beginning of the Empire is usually taken as the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, who ascended the throne in 1611, and the end as the loss of territories in 1721 following the Great Northern War. In Swedish history, the period is referred to as \\"stormaktstiden\\", literally meaning \\"the Great Power era\\".  - Yakov Karlovich Grot ( Russian :    ) ( December 27 ( O.S. December 15 ) 1812 -- June 5 ( O.S. May 24 ) 1893 ) , was a nineteenth - century Russian philologist of German extraction who worked at the University of Helsinki . Grot was a graduate of the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum . In his lifetime he gained fame for his translations of German and Scandinavian poetry , his work on the theory of Russian orthography , lexicography , and grammar , and his approach to literary editing and criticism , exemplified in a full edition of the works of Derzhavin ( 1864 -- 1883 ) . His Russkoye Pravopisaniye ( 1878 , 1885 ) (   , Russian orthography ) became the standard textbook of Russian spelling and punctuation until superseded by the decrees of 1917 -- 1918 , although his definition of the theoretical foundations remains little changed to this day . Shortly before his death , he assumed the compilation of Academic dictionary of Russian ( 1891 -- 1923 ) , which , although continued by Aleksey Shakhmatov , was never to be completed . He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences from 1858 , its chairman from 1884 , and its vice-president from 1889 . He was appointed Russian - language tutor to the future tsars Alexander II and Alexander III. His spelling primers \`\` reduced words to historical hieroglyphs of a kind , mismatched with the living spoken language of most Russians '' ; later linguists like Baudouin de Courtenay and Filipp Fortunatov promoted reforms that would make spelling a better reflection of spoken language .  - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.  Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education.  - The University of Helsinki (, , abbreviated UH) is a university located in Helsinki, Finland since 1829, but was founded in the city of Turku (in Swedish \\"Åbo\\") in 1640 as the \\"Royal Academy of Turku\\", at that time part of the Swedish Empire. It is the oldest and largest university in Finland with the widest range of disciplines available. Around 36,500 students are currently enrolled in the degree programs of the university spread across 11 faculties and 11 research institutes.  - The Royal Academy of Turku (or \\"Åbo Kungliga Akademi\\", ) was the first university in Finland, and the only Finnish university that was founded when the country still was a part of Sweden. In 1809, after Finland became a Grand Duchy under the suzerainty of the Russian Tzar, it was renamed the \\"Imperial Academy of Turku\\". In 1828, after the Great Fire of Turku, the institution was moved to Helsinki, in line with the relocation of the Grand Duchy's capital. It was finally renamed the University of Helsinki when Finland became a sovereign nation-state in 1917.  - Helsinki  is the capital and largest city of Finland. It is in the region of Uusimaa, in southern Finland, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. Helsinki has a population of , an urban population of 1,214,210, and a metropolitan population of over 1.4 million, making it the most populous municipality and urban area in Finland. Helsinki is located some north of Tallinn, Estonia, east of Stockholm, Sweden, and west of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Helsinki has close historical connections with these three cities.  - Turku is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Southwest Finland. Turku, as a town, was settled during the 13th century and founded most likely at the end of the 13th century, making it the oldest city in Finland. It quickly became the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years. After Finland became part of the Russian Empire (1809) and the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812), Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains a regional capital and an important business and cultural center.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region.

He meets Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), a young Romanian-born patient in the hospital who is recovering from a broken arm, and begins to tell her a story about her namesake. Alexandria is told she has to leave, but Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she returns the next day. The next morning, as Roy spins his tale of fantasy, Alexandria's imagination brings his characters to life. Roy's tale is about five heroes: a silent Indian warrior (Jeetu Verma), a muscular ex-slave named Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley), an Italian explosives expert called Luigi (Robin Smith), Charles Darwin (Leo Bill) with a pet monkey called Wallace, and a masked swashbuckling bandit. An evil ruler named Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone) has committed an offense against each of the five, who all seek revenge. The heroes are later joined by a sixth hero, a mystic. Alexandria vividly imagines her friends and people around her appearing as the characters in Roy's story. Although Roy develops affection for Alexandria, he also has an ulterior motive: by gaining her trust, he tricks her into stealing morphine from the hospital pharmacy so that he can attempt suicide; a choice driven by his love leaving him for the actor for whom he provided the stunt footage. However, Alexandria returns with only three pills, having mistaken the \\"E\\" on the piece of paper Roy gave her for a \\"3\\".

Roy talks Alexandria into stealing a bottle of morphine tablets locked in a fellow patient's cabinet, and then downs it all.

This used to be my favorite place uptown.  Really disappointed. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with the service they experienced at their formerly favorite uptown location. The detailed account of their visit highlights various issues that collectively contribute to the negative sentiment: 1. Lack of immediate attention or acknowledgement: The reviewer mentions that they were seated for ten minutes without any interaction from the staff, which can be seen as a lack of consideration and attentiveness in regard to customer service. 2. Avoidance of eye contact: The fact that a waitress passed their table twice without making eye contact indicates a possible disregard for their presence or intentional avoidance. This behavior can be perceived as unprofessional and neglectful, causing frustration for the customer. 3. Inattention from multiple staff members: The reviewer notes that servers congregated at the hostess stand rather than attending to their duties, giving the impression of an overall lack of focus and commitment to customer service. This observation further emphasizes the lack of attention and care from the staff. 4. No response upon leaving: Despite walking out in disappointment, the reviewer states that no staff members noticed or attempted to address their dissatisfaction, reinforcing the idea of unsatisfactory customer service. 5. Disappointment in a favorite place: The fact that the location was once their favorite uptown spot highlights the disappointment and dissatisfaction felt by the customer. A decline in the quality of service can lead to a strong negative sentiment, especially in a place that previously held a special significance to the reviewer. By focusing on these points, the reviewer conveys a detailed and negative sentiment toward their recent experience. It is clear that their expectations were not met and they left with a strong sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction regarding the service and overall visit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Understand that even if you were an outstanding undergraduate (as most graduate students were), you will face an entirely different set of challenges in graduate school. The specific nature of your coursework, research, teaching, and laboratory obligations will vary tremendously depending on your field, your school, and your department, and so will your potential paychecks and funding packages, so do some research and figure out what, exactly, you’re signing up for.  Many department websites will answer your basic questions about particular programs, so start there to get a sense of what your obligations as a graduate student might be. Consider contacting current students as well. Most programs have a Director of Graduate Studies who can put you in touch with students in your program. You can then send an email or two to ask more specific questions. Current students may have insights about the standard workload and funding packages, and – unlike the website – they may be forthcoming about the potential downsides of pursuing a degree in their department. Graduate school is not something to do just because you can’t think of anything else to do with your life. No one should sink years of time, money, and energy into a graduate degree without being crystal clear about his or her goals and what is required to achieve them. This goes double for people with families. Know your reasons for pursuing a graduate degree, and do some extra research about what your opportunities will look like after graduate school – don’t just assume that your M.A. or Ph.D. will get you a wonderful job. Many people in the academic world are reluctant to admit this, but the job market for academics is abysmal right now, especially in the humanities and social sciences. If you are pursuing a graduate degree in one of these fields, think twice: even if you go to a top program and do well, you may find yourself, five to ten years down the road, with an impressive Ph.D., considerable debt, and no job. For graduate students with a family, this might be especially troubling. Do your research, and go in with your eyes open (if at all). If you are married or in a committed relationship, it is imperative to discuss the upcoming challenges with your spouse or partner. For most people with families, beginning a graduate program will entail some combination of relocating, quitting jobs, creating a new budget, making new child-care arrangements, and re-evaluating the division of household labor. These are major, life-changing developments, so work to discuss them openly and honestly. If your partner is not an academic, he or she may not fully understand what your new commitments will look like. Once you’ve done the research yourself, make sure you pass along your knowledge and clear up potential misunderstandings – let your partner know, for example, if you think you’ll need to work on weekends or travel for research. If your children are old enough to understand, you’ll need to discuss your plans openly with them as well. Remember that your decision to attend graduate school will change their lives, too: they will likely need to adjust to new schools or child-care facilities, changes in their schedules, and less time with you. Be up front with them, in a way that’s appropriate to their ages and maturity levels, and explain why you’re taking this path. Whatever your financial circumstances, graduate school is an expense to be considered carefully. Ideally, you should avoid going to graduate school, especially in the humanities and social sciences, unless you are fully funded by your program of choice – “fully funded” generally meaning that you receive a tuition waiver and a modest monthly stipend, often in exchange for teaching or laboratory duties. But people with families should be extra cautious, especially since “full funding” will probably not include money for expenses like child care.  Research child-care costs ahead of time. If you’ve been a stay-at-home parent and plan to pay for child care for the first time, you may have no idea how expensive these services can be. If you’re quitting a “real world” job to attend graduate school, you may not realize how insufficient your stipend will be once you subtract the costs of child care from it. Either way, you need to know what you’re getting into. Be sure you look into any tax credits or deductions associated with child care costs.  Factor in changes to your partner’s income, too. If you’re married or in a committed relationship, your partner’s income also needs to be assessed. Are you moving to attend graduate school? If so, your partner will probably have to find a new job – how will you pay the bills in the meantime? Will your decision to attend graduate school affect your partner’s work schedule or potential for overtime hours? If so, you need to consider that as well. You may be tempted to get as much financial aid as possible from the government, but though this decision might be appealing right now, it’s probably unwise in the long term. Ph.D. programs, especially, take a very long time; the debt will add up, and then, in the end, you’ll face the horrible academic job market. How will you pay it back?","output":"Graduate school can be very different from undergraduate studies and requires careful planning, especially for those with families; it is important to research your specific program, the job market after graduation, and discuss the changes with your partner and children to make the best decision."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Andrew Mark Cuomo (born December 6, 1957) is an American politician who has been the 56th Governor of New York since January 1, 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected in 2010, holding the same position his father, Mario Cuomo, held for three terms from 1983 to 1995.  - The Governor of the State of New York is the chief executive of the U.S. state of New York. The governor is the head of the executive branch of New York's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military and naval forces.  - A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state. In federations, \\"governor\\" may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal and largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government.  - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.  - A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.  - Charles J. O'Byrne ( born 1959 ) is an executive at Related Rentals Companies , an American lawyer and former political staffer to Governor of New York David Paterson , serving as Secretary to the Governor . The position , according to then New York Daily News blogger Elizabeth Benjamin , is considered the most powerful in Albany after the Governor himself . He is openly gay . O'Byrne previously served as Chief of Staff to Paterson during his time as Lieutenant Governor of New York as well as in the New York State Senate . He also worked as a speech writer for Howard Dean 's 2004 presidential campaign . Prior to entering politics , O'Byrne became an attorney and subsequently joined the Catholic priesthood , and was a member of the Society of Jesus for twelve years . He wrote and sold a manuscript to Crowne , a division of Random House , with a working title Going My Way , a memoir of his time in religious formation and as a priest but has held back on releasing the book . An article touching on some of the topics considered in his manuscript was published in Playboy magazine in 2002 . He is now a practicing Episcopalian . O'Byrne is an active athlete having completed two New York City Marathons and in June 2007 completed his first triathlon .  - David Alexander Paterson (born May 20, 1954) is an American politician. He was the 55th Governor of New York, in office from 2008 to 2010. He was the first African American governor of New York and also the second legally blind governor of any U.S. state after Bob C. Riley, who was Acting Governor of Arkansas for 11 days in January 1975. Since leaving office, Paterson has been a radio talk show host on station WOR in New York City, and was in 2014 appointed Chairman of the New York Democratic Party by his successor as governor, Andrew Cuomo.

Our goal is to find out what 's' is. Here's the equation we have: -113 * s = -222 * s - 259 - 286 Step 1: Let's combine the numbers on the right side that don't have the letter 's' with them: -259 - 286 = -545  So, now our equation looks like this: -113 * s = -222 * s - 545 Step 2: Let's get all the 's' terms on one side. We can do this by adding 222 * s to both sides of the equation: (-113 * s) + (222 * s) = (-222 * s) + (222 * s) - 545 This will make our equation look like this: 109 * s = -545 Step 3: To find the value of 's', we need to get rid of the 109 attached to it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 109: (109 * s) / 109 = -545 / 109 Now, our equation looks like this: s = -5 And that's it! The value of 's' is -5.

Problem:Paragraph: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an emerging respiratory disease caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS has been endemic to Saudi Arabia since 2012. The reservoir of MERS-CoV is the dromedary camel, suggesting that MERS is primarily a zoonotic disease. MERS-CoV is common in dromedaries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa as evidenced by neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV; however, human cases have remained limited to the Middle East. To better understand the cause of this difference, the virological properties of African camel MERS-CoV were analyzed based on the spike (S) protein in Ethiopia. Nasal swabs were collected from 258 young dromedaries (≤ 2 years old) in the Afar region of Ethiopia, of which 39 were positive for MERS-CoV, as confirmed by genetic tests. All positive tests were exclusive to the Amibara woreda region. Using next-generation sequencing, two full-length genomes of Amibara isolates were successfully decoded; both isolates belonged to the C2 clade based on phylogenetic analysis of full-length and S protein sequences. Recombinant EMC isolates of MERS-CoV, in which the S protein is replaced with those of Amibara isolates, were then generated to test the roles of these proteins in viral properties. Amibara S recombinants replicated more slowly in cultured cells than in EMC S recombinants. In neutralizing assays, Amibara S recombinants were neutralized by lower concentrations of sera from both Ethiopian dromedaries and EMC isolate (wild-type)immunized mouse sera, relative to the EMC S recombinants, indicating that viruses coated in the Amibara S protein were easier to neutralize than the EMC S protein. Neutralization experiments performed using S1/S2 chimeric recombinants of the EMC and Amibara S proteins showed that the neutralization profile was dependent on the S1 region of the S protein. These results suggest that the slower viral replication and the ease of neutralization seen in the Ethiopian MERS-CoV are due to strain-specific differences in the S protein and may account for the absence of human MERS-CoV cases in Ethiopia.

News article: Spending £250,000 on an engagement ring is just asking for trouble What a mysterious carry-on in St Tropez last week, when Jenson Button and his wife Jessica Michibata were apparently gassed and robbed in their villa, and woke up feeling ghastly to find Jessica’s £250,000 engagement ring missing. Was the robber gang Russian? How did they get the huge container of gas up the drive and administer it? Or did the Buttons just have a frightful hangover? Who knows, but there’s another much more baffling mystery here: why have a £250,000 ring in the first place? It’s just asking for trouble. I inherited my mother’s diamond ring, which is titchy and worth peanuts compared to Jessica’s, but I still wouldn’t dare wear it outdoors. What if I lost it? And, around here, the odds are that someone would wrench it from my finger, or simply chop my finger off. I don’t even dare have it in the house, in case burglars sniff it out, so it’s hidden away in the bank, and one day, when I’m old and broke, I can perhaps use it to keep myself in gruel for years. My mother used to wear it bravely, but, as she grew older and sicker, the ring became more of a burden, causing nothing but worry. Every time she was carted off to hospital, her desperate parting words would be: “Take my ring.” She was sure that, if it was left on her finger, it would be nicked while she was asleep, drugged or out cold on the operating table, and gone by the time I reached her deathbed. So, I would take it and hide it until she came home – a terrifying responsibility. But, even when my mother was young and healthy, the ring caused problems. One day, when my Auntie Milly had just remarried, she asked to look at it. “Can I see your ring, Clarice?” My mother held up her hand. Milly held up her own, and her new engagement ring, and smiled dreamily. “Mine is bigger!” said she, enraging my mother. Good job Milly didn’t stand next to Jessica.

What is the answer to this question? where is the biggest macy's in new york?","output":"The largest Macy's store in New York, as well as in the world, is the Macy's Herald Square store, which is located in Manhattan.  The store occupies an entire city block, reaching from Broadway to Seventh Avenue along 34th Street. It is a remarkable shopping destination known for its historical significance, diversified selection of merchandise, and dramatic window displays especially during Christmas and Thanksgiving.  Macy's Herald Square was first opened as a dry goods store by R.H. Macy & Co in 1858 at the corner of 14th Street and 6th Avenue, but it wasn't until 1902 that the store moved to its current location in Herald Square. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978, and it underwent a major renovation that was completed in 2015.  This flagship store covers 2.5 million square feet and stands 9 stories tall, which makes it one of the world's largest department stores. It boasts a variety of luxury brands, a huge shoe department, a beauty and perfume department, home goods, clothing, and much more. One of its prominent features is the world's largest wooden escalator, a throwback to the early days of department stores.

But Lucien,the stars are still there,and one day,when you are older and your tears have gone,you will see them again.And,in a strange way,I expect that you will find your father there,too,in your mind and heart.I find that my parents,who died years ago,still figure in many of my dreams and that I think of them perhaps more than I ever did when they were alive.I still live to please them and I'm still surprised by their reactions.I remember that when I became a professor,I was so proud,or rather so pleased with myself that I couldn't wait to cable my parents.The reply was a long time in coming,but when it did,all my mother said was \\"I hope this means that now you will have more time for the children!\\" I haven't forgotten.The values of my parents still live on. It makes me pause and think about how I will live on in the hearts and minds of my children and of those for whom I care.Would I have been as ready as Philip Lawrence have been to face the aggressors,and to lay down my life for those in my care?How many people would want me back for Christmas?It's a serious thought,one to give me pause.

Neither were shy of goals or games - Lampard would go on to make 609 Premier League appearances to Gerrard's 504, scoring 177 goals to the Liverpudlian's 120. In his most prolific season, 2009-10, Lampard scored 22 goals in 36 games as he claimed the third of three Premier League winner's medals with Chelsea. He had previously won the title in 2004-05 and 2005-06. The closest Gerrard's Liverpool came to a league title was the season of his infamous 'slip' against Chelsea in 2013-14. That season, he weighed in with 13 goals and 13 assists from midfield. Gerrard missed out on a Premier League crown, but the hometown hero guided his club to Champions League success in 2005, as well as two FA Cups, three League Cups, a Uefa Cup and a Uefa Super Cup. But it is Lampard who boasts the most silverware. Football finance expert Rob Wilson says if you took both players in their prime and sold them in last month's transfer window, Lampard would attract a marginally higher fee. But neither would match the world-record £89m Manchester United spent to re-sign Paul Pogba from Juventus. \\"I wouldn't put them on the same level as what we have seen with Pogba, simply because of the marketability of Pogba and his association with Adidas,\\" said Wilson, from Sheffield Hallam University. \\"Hindsight is a perfect science. We have seen the performances they were able to generate for their respective clubs, the consistency they were able to deliver and, particularly in the case of Lampard, the goals he scored as well. \\"You would be comfortably talking £50m-£60m in transfer value - Lampard would be slightly more because of the number of goals he scored from midfield. \\"If we were to have seen them sold this summer or next summer, you would be talking about wage packets of £250,000 a week.\\" This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser During their final seasons in England, both players were included in the Sunday Times Rich List, with Gerrard's wealth in 2015 calculated at £42m, and Lampard's at £39m. While Lampard only once commanded a transfer fee, Chelsea signing him for £11m from West Ham in 2001, Gerrard left Anfield only when his contract expired in 2015, 18 years after signing his first professional deal. Having first played in the same England team in 2002, Lampard and Gerrard featured 73 times together before both retired in the summer of 2014. Despite the suggestion the duo \\"couldn't play together\\", during that time England won 63% of their games with both in the team, and 51% without. Gerrard was the more successful of the two when playing on his own, England winning 61% of 41 games, compared with 48.5% of the 33 matches with just Lampard involved. Lampard made his debut a year before Gerrard's first England appearance, but it was the Liverpool man who established himself first, scoring his first international goal in the 5-1 win over Germany in 2001, and captaining his country at three major tournaments. Squeezing two of England's most glittering members of the 'golden generation' into one midfield was seen to be a problem for a string of national managers, but BBC Sport football analyst Pat Nevin believes the issue lay with the coaches rather than the players. \\"The problem wasn't Gerrard or Lampard, the problem was the managers,\\" said former Scotland international Nevin. \\"I don't think it was that complicated what they had to do, so that was a huge disappointment. \\"Playing within a system, England tended to play 4-4-2 and teams were never stretched. There were two guys who were phenomenal at going into space and finding space, but had nowhere to run.\\" Gerrard's performances in a Liverpool shirt sometimes led to the perception he had single-handedly dragged his team-mates towards glory, not least in the Champions League final against AC Milan in 2005 and the Reds' FA Cup triumph over West Ham a year later. Lampard, meanwhile, was no doubt a great player, reaching double figures for goals in 10 successive Premier League seasons, but was his career helped by playing in world-class Chelsea teams? In a bid to compare who played in the better side, we took the XIs that started the clubs' respective Champions League-winning finals and calculated the reported cost of each player to see how expensive the teams were to assemble. Gerrard was part of the Liverpool side that came from 3-0 down at half-time to beat AC Milan on penalties in the 'Miracle of Istanbul'. That team would go on to boast 635 caps between them, with Gerrard's 114 England appearances matched by Spain's Xabi Alonso, while Norway's John Arne Riise (110) and Finland's Sami Hyypia (105) also reached their centuries. With Liverpool's success seven years earlier than Chelsea's, it is inevitable their starting XI would be cheaper than the Blues'. But at face value the Anfield outfit built their European victory for £100m less, with the side that started in Turkey costing a combined £40.35m. Chelsea's Champions League triumph also came via a penalty shootout, the Blues beating Bayern Munich on German soil. Lampard was among the scorers from the spot after Didier Drogba's late goal levelled the game in 90 minutes. Lampard (106) was one of four Chelsea players to win more than 100 caps for his country, with Petr Cech (Czech Republic, 124), Ashley Cole (England, 107) and Drogba (Ivory Coast, 104) contributing to a total 784 caps for the Blues. The cost of that side? £140.1m - and that's not including Fernando Torres (£50m) and Michael Essien (£24.4m), who were on the bench in Munich. This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser Phil Neville, who played alongside the pair for England and against them for Manchester United and Everton, told BBC Sport they were \\"always driving each other on to be better\\". \\"If Frank scored a goal, Stevie had to score a goal,\\" he added. \\"It's what great players do and you see it with how Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi compete with each other. You are inspired by the biggest challenges. \\"It was a strength and a weakness of why they couldn't play together, in a way. \\"I think Stevie, in his club career, maybe felt a little bit on his own at times. Maybe he looked at Frank as part of a great team, winning league titles and other cups - whereas he made Liverpool a good team by his own performances.\\" As players of such similar style and stature in the game, leaving the Premier League for the MLS only furthered the Lampard-Gerrard debate. Gerrard joined LA Galaxy for the 2015-16 season, while Lampard chose New York City. Over the course of two campaigns in the MLS, Gerrard made 36 appearances to Lampard's 31. However, it was the former West Ham, Chelsea and Manchester City man who turned a stuttering Stateside start around to eventually make the bigger impact for his club, scoring 15 times including his 300th career goal. Lampard on Gerrard: \\"There were many a night I can recall Stevie driving from midfield at Anfield and I tried to reverse that at Chelsea and be our driving force. \\"There's a huge respect we both have for each other. We get on very well, particularly in our latter years. It's nice to come up against Stevie.\\" Gerrard on Lampard: \\"When that whistle goes and for 90 minutes when we are competing against each other it is war. We fight against each other, we always have. And when it's over there is a mutual respect there. \\"I'm a huge fan of Frank. He's a phenomenal goalscorer from midfield. I play in the same position myself so I understand how difficult that is.\\" Following some fantastic battles on the field, will Gerrard and Lampard renew their rivalry in the technical area? Gerrard is set to begin his coaching career at Anfield, where the Liverpool legend will work with the club's youth teams. He was linked with the manager's job at League One side MK Dons last year but said the opportunity had come \\"too soon\\" for him. Lampard, meanwhile, has said he will study for his coaching qualifications with the Football Association - meaning they could yet line up in opposing dugouts.

When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards.

Write some highlights for the following article: Robbie Williams has become embroiled in a planning dispute with his  Led Zeppelin legend neighbour Jimmy Page. The former Take That star wants to do up his £17million mansion in Holland Park, west London by installing a lift and a recording studio. But his plans have not gone down well with neighbour Jimmy Page, who has objected to the changes in a strongly-worded letter to Kensington and Chelsea Council. Scroll down for video. Robbie Williams wants to make a number of alterations to his £17.5million mansion (left) in Holland Park, west London - but Jimmy Page who lives in a turreted home nearby (right) objects to the changes. Page (right) - the guitarist for Led Zeppelin - fears the building work may impact on his own property. Williams, 40, bought the 46-room mansion from late film director Michael Winner in 2013. He now wants to carry out a number of interior alterations to turn the Victorian mansion into a contemporary family home. The plans - which also include the installation of a lift and a recording studio - have been poorly received by Page, who lives in the Grade I listed Tower House nearby. The musician - whose band's hits included Whole Lotta Love - has owned the landmark home for more than 40 years and regards it as one of the most important properties in the borough. In a strongly-worded letter to the council, Page has expressed a number of concerns. He wrote: 'I have been responsible for the protection of the Tower House for over 40 years and I am always concerned when proposals are made for nearby properties which may be detrimental to the well-being of this important heritage asset.' Page says because Williams' house is Grade II listed, the exterior should be considered 'sacrosanct'. The famous pair have lived next door to each other for more than a year but have fallen out over the plans. Williams bought the house - which is the former home of Michael Winner - with his wife Ayda Field in 2013. Page - pictured (left) recently with his girlfriend Scarlett Sabet, 25, and (right) in Led Zeppelin's 1970s heyday - says Williams' home is Grade II listed and its exterior should be treated as 'sacrosanct' He says a new window planned will overlook the side of his house and his back garden, which will have a 'significant impact on the amenity' of his property. The rockstar is also concerned that work on the underground swimming pool could cause 'vibrations and possible structural' damage to Tower House. Page, aged 71, also objects to Williams knocking down part of his home's boundary wall to allow access to a planned garden car park. He wrote: '[This] will be detrimental to the general amenity of the conservation area as well as destroying part of the attractive boundary wall.' Williams' planning application states the building work will take place from early this month until October this year, with workmen accessing the site between 8am and 6pm on Mondays to Fridays and 8am and 1pm on Saturdays. He promises no work will be carried out on Sundays or Bank Holidays and reversing vehicles will be guided in by 'suitably qualified banksman'. The house's main bedroom, pictured during the time the late Michael Winner lived at the property. Williams bought the house in 2013, after the director's death, and is now keen to renovate the property. The west London mansion, pictured in 2011 when Winner tried to sell it, includes a swimming pool room. Page bought Tower House in 1972. The 19th century, Grade I listed home was built by William Burgess and, in the 1960s, was saved from demolition after a campaign led by John Betjeman and Evelyn Waugh. Williams' house also has a colourful history. The property was bought by George Winner for £2,000 in 1946. It was the home Michael Winner grew up in. The Death Wish director took the property over in 1978, transforming it from three flats into his own personal palace. Winner put the mansion on the market for £60 million in 2011, but he couldn't find a buyer. The director passed away in January 2013, with Williams buying the home later that year for £17.5 million. He submitted the plans to Kensington and Chelsea Council in December with the public consultation ending on January 2. A decision on the plans is expected by the end of the month. Both parties declined to comment. Plans on the local council's website show the extent to which Williams plans to re-tile his home's roof. They also show how he wants to demolish parts of inside walls and build a new window (top left of plan) The designs show the window (bottom left of plan) that Page has complained about to council officials.

She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it.

Friday April 13, 2001 02:45 PM By Lance Hornby, SLAM! Sports The sequel to last year's Battle of Ontario means much more than provincial bragging rights for the Maple Leafs. This series against the Ottawa Senators -- which starts tonight with 96 hours of compacted scheduling for Games 1, 2 and 3 -- could change the face of the Leafs, from the front office to the bench. Captain Mats Sundin's contract is up, coach/general manager Pat Quinn could lose one of his two jobs, veterans such as Steve Thomas are getting long in the tooth and the much hyped \\"built for playoffs\\" philosophy is under heavy scrutiny. The board of directors will be looking over Quinn's shoulders, Quinn will be judging the players and anxious fans will be expecting results. Somewhere out there, Eric Lindros is lurking. \\"Last year we had some pretty good success and (faces) still changed around here,\\" forward Darcy Tucker said as the Leafs headed for the airport. \\"Anytime expectations rise for a hockey team, so does the mandate of the hockey club if you don't get the job done. \\"I'm sure every guy in this dressing room wants to be back next year, but if we don't accomplish what we want to, maybe that's not going to happen.\\" Sundin, points leader here for seven consecutive seasons, said a new contract is \\"the last thing on my mind.\\" \\"I'm not management,\\" he said of looming changes. \\"But we have to prove to people we're a better team. \\"We made some changes in the off-season and it's up to the new guys and the guys who were here before to show that we're good enough.\\" After a week of steady practices and a chance to forget Saturday's fifth loss in as many games this season to Ottawa, the Leafs really didn't care that most hockey writers in North America have dismissed them. \\"Two years ago, there were really no expectations on the team and we ended up playing in the conference final,\\" Sundin said. \\"The feeling now is similar to that. No one felt we were going to beat out Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and there's no reason we can't have a run like that or a better one this year.\\" Winger Garry Valk, a likely scratch tonight with a lingering eye injury, says the unfamiliar role of underdogs and opening on the road is not the end of the world. \\"It doesn't matter if you scored 50 goals in the regular season,\\" Valk said. \\"Ask guys such as Jonas Hoglund.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Are both Porcelaine and Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore scenthounds crossed with Foxhounds? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the breeds involved In this question, we need to analyze whether both Porcelaine and Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore scenthounds are crossed with Foxhounds. To do this, we should first understand the characteristics and breeding history of these breeds. Step 2: Research breed history Porcelaine: The Porcelaine is a rare breed of scenthound that originated in France. It is known for its keen sense of smell and high-energy personality, which make it an excellent hunting companion. It was historically used for hunting small game, particularly hare and roe deer. Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore: The Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore is another scenthound breed originating in France, known for their prowess in hunting foxes, deer, and wild boar. They are large, powerful dogs that combine speed, stamina, and excellent scenting abilities to excel in their hunting roles. Foxhound: Foxhounds are scent hounds that originated in England and are prized for their ability to track and hunt foxes. They have excellent stamina, are fast runners, and are known for their good nature and adaptability. Step 3: Analyze breeding relationships Now that we have a basic understanding of these breeds, we can analyze the breeding relationships between them. Porcelaine and Foxhound: While the Porcelaine is a French breed, and Foxhounds are an English breed, both breeds share some similarities in their skill of hunting. However, there is no direct evidence or documentation to suggest that Porcelaines were crossed with Foxhounds during the development of the breed. Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore and Foxhound: The Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore is a breed that resulted from the crossing of French scenthounds with English Foxhounds in the 19th century. As a result, it has inherited some of the best characteristics, such as excellent hunting skills and a keen sense of smell, from both breeds. Conclusion: Based on the breed histories and breeding relationships, it can be concluded that the Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore scenthound is indeed crossed with Foxhounds, but the Porcelaine scenthound is not."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.  - The Equator usually refers to an imaginary line on the Earth's surface equidistant from the North Pole and South Pole, dividing the Earth into the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

Their bathroom was clean and their staff were nice.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed with a negative leaning. The reviewer's overall experience at the restaurant appears to be unsatisfactory, mainly due to several factors that negatively impacted their visit. First and foremost, the food does not seem to have met the reviewer's expectations. The cashier recommended three flavors to add to their roast beef, but the review does not explicitly mention whether the customer was satisfied with the flavor combinations. Instead, they focus on their dissatisfaction with the duration it took for their order to be served. The mention of having \\"4 tables and 3 of them already eating their food\\" communicates the reviewer's disappointment over the slow service, despite the restaurant's seemingly low occupancy. Furthermore, the reviewer's negative sentiment continues with their mention of the poor taste of the tap water. This critique provides a clear indication of their negative impression of certain aspects of the dining experience. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the review also includes a couple of positive comments. The reviewer mentions that the bathroom was clean and the staff were nice, which are favorable aspects that might be appreciated by potential diners. However, these positive points are not enough to outweigh the negative experiences that the reviewer has emphasized. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review can be described as mixed with a negative leaning, as the reviewer had an overall unsatisfactory experience. The slow service, poor taste of tap water, and potentially underwhelming food overshadow the positive remarks about the cleanliness and friendly staff. This may deter potential customers from visiting the establishment, as the priority for most diners is typically excellent food and service."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  The \\"magnificent and accurate\\" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterprise—he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project. In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that \\"splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition\\".  The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes.  Each play had its own title page followed by a list of \\"Persons in the Drama\\".   Boydell spared no expense.  He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition.  Nicol explains in the preface that they \\"established a printing-house ... [and] a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink\\". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805. Boydell was responsible for the \\"splendor\\", and George Steevens, the general editor, was responsible for the \\"correctness of text\\". Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was \\"at first an ardent advocate of the plan\\" but \\"soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers\\". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint.

However, if they fall behind on payments, a \\"repo man\\" reclaims the artificial organ (artiforg) from the body; the procedure frequently results in the death of the customer due to them being crucial organs. Remy and his partner Jake Freivald are considered the best of the Union's repo men. However, Remy's wife Carol disapproves of his work, believing that it is a bad influence for their son Peter. At a family barbecue, Jake does a quick repossession on a passenger in a cab using a kitchen knife. Carol sees this and leaves with Peter, urging Remy to make a decision. While out driving with Jake, they discover a \\"nest\\", a refuge for Union customers who have defaulted on payments for their artiforgs and become fugitives to avoid the repo men. Remy and Jake raid the nest by themselves and reclaim 32 artiforgs, which impresses their boss Frank. He offers them the opportunity to become full-time raid captains. Remy refuses and attempts to ask Frank to transfer to sales, but Jake cuts him off. Jake tells Remy that what they do is important, but Remy's mind is made up. Jake suggests that Remy's last job be a musician that Remy is a fan of. After helping the musician finish one last song, he uses a defibrillator in order to stop the artificial heart, but the device malfunctions, and Remy is severely injured, requiring replacement of his heart with an artiforg. Carol divorces Remy for taking another job, so he moves in with Jake. In sales, he is unable to lie to potential customers about the consequences of non-payment and is forced back into repo to pay for his heart, but has developed sympathy for his victims and develops a psychological block that prevents him from repossessing their artiforgs....

To find the LCS in the given lists A and B, we can use the dynamic programming approach. First, let's represent the two given lists as: A = ['r', 'u', 6461, '9255', 'T', 'D', '6367', 'i', 's', 'l'] B = [7049, 6243, '9255', 'T', 'D', '6367', 'i', 'D', 8875, 'J', 4035] Now, create a 2D table (dp) with dimensions (len(A)+1) x (len(B)+1). Initialize all dp[i][0] and dp[0][j] values to 0, where 1 ≤ i ≤ len(A) and 1 ≤ j ≤ len(B). Then, iterate through the table and perform the following steps: 1. If the elements at the current indices A[i-1] and B[j-1] are equal, set the current cell value as dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. 2. If not, set the value as the maximum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1]. At the end of the iteration, the last cell dp[len(A)][len(B)] will store the length of the longest common subsequence.

Here is a detailed and long response to the core issue: There could be several reasons why you are unable to see or find your bookmarked answers on Quora. Some of the potential causes and possible solutions to this problem are listed below: 1. Account settings or synchronization issues: The first possibility is that there may be an issue with your account settings or synchronization. Quora relies heavily on real-time synchronization of data from their servers to your device. If your settings are configured incorrectly, or your device experiences synchronization issues, then you may not be able to access your bookmarked answers. Solution: Make sure you are logged into the correct account on Quora. Additionally, ensure that your device is connected to the internet, and the Quora app or website has the necessary permissions to access your device's data. 2. Platform-dependent limitations: If you are using either the mobile app or website version of Quora, it is possible that you may be experiencing platform-dependent limitations. Certain features available on the desktop version of the website may not be available in the mobile app, and vice-versa. Solution: Try accessing Quora on both the mobile app and website version using a desktop web browser. This may help you identify if the problem is specific to one platform. 3. Quora updates: Quora frequently updates its platform to fix bugs, add new features, and improve existing functionalities. Due to these updates, it is possible that your bookmarking feature may be temporarily disabled or functioning differently. Solution: Check for updates or announcements from Quora about any changes to the bookmark feature. If you find that there has been an update, read the release notes to find out about any modifications to the bookmark feature and follow the instructions to get it working again. 4. Accidental deletion of bookmarks: There is a possibility that you may have accidentally deleted or un-bookmarked some of your bookmarked answers. This would result in them not appearing in your bookmarks list. Solution: Carefully review your bookmarks to ensure you have not mistakenly deleted or unmarked any of your saved answers. If you find that you did, unfortunately, there is no way to recover the deleted bookmarks. However, you may be able to locate the original answers by searching through your browsing history or using Quora's search feature to find the answers manually. 5. Quora policy and moderation: Quora has a set of community guidelines and policies in place to protect its users and maintain the quality of the content on the platform. Sometimes, content that violates these guidelines may be removed by the platform moderators or due to user reports. If any of your bookmarked answers were removed, they will no longer show up in your bookmarks. Solution: Unfortunately, there is no way to recover removed content. The best course of action in this case is to find alternative answers that serve the same purpose and bookmark them instead. In conclusion, the inability to view or find your bookmarked answers on Quora can indeed stem from issues related to account synchronization, platform limitations, platform updates, accidental deletions, or content moderation. By following the mentioned solutions and understanding the potential reasons behind the problem, you can effectively tackle this inconvenience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Dutch Take Over: Intent on capturing a piece of the Portuguese trade in pepper and other spices, the Java-based Dutch Ailied with the Malays in 1633 to blockade Melaka. The trade blockade was to last eight years, and ended in a seven-month siege. The Portuguese surrendered in 1641, wracked by malaria and dysentery and denied their usual reinforcements from Goa. By then, the city had become a stagnant backwater. Unlike the Portuguese, the Dutch decided to do business with the Malays of Johor, who controlled the southern half of the peninsula together with Singapore and the neighboring Riau islands. A trade treaty gave the Dutch command of the spice trade but reserved Johor's rights in tin exports from Perak, Selangor, and Klang. Without ever retrieving the supremacy of the old Melaka sultanate, Johor had become the strongest Asian power in the region. For the Dutch, Johor provided a buffer against other Europeans. Meanwhile, fresh blood came in with the migration into the southern interior of hardy Minangkabau farmers from Sumatra, while tough Bugis warriors from the east Indonesian Celebes (Sulawesi) roved the length and breadth of the peninsula. The Minangkabau custom of freely electing their leaders provided the model for rulership elections in modern federal Malaysia. Their confederation of States became today's Negeri Sembilan (\\"Nine States\\"), with Seremban as its capital. The name Minangkabau itself means roughly \\"buffalo horns\\" and is reflected in the distinctive upward curving roof in museums and government offices built in the traditional Minangkabau style. The Bugis were energetic merchants and great sailors. With the Dutch concentrating once more on Java and the Moluccas in the 18th century, the Bugis took advantage of the vacuum by raiding Perak and Kedah, imposing their chieftains in Selangor and becoming the power behind the throne in Johor. The Bugis in Johor's administration provided much of the spirit in that State's independent stand in the 19th and 20th centuries. Throughout this period, the east coast states enjoyed a relatively tranquil prosperity, Terengganu notably thriving from its textile industry and trading in pepper and gold with the Thais, Cambodians, and Chinese. The British, under the private auspices of the East India Company (EIC), were beginning to poke their noses into North Borneo.

Mix the detergent with water and dip a washcloth in the solution. Wipe the pads and gloves with the washcloth, removing any dirt and debris.  Adding a tablespoon of fabric softener to the detergent solution can help eliminate odors and make your pads and gloves flexible. You can check your detergent's pH levels by reading the label, checking online, or contacting its manufacturer. Do not put your pads or gloves in the dryer, as this can damage any leather or plastic pieces. Instead, stuff the pads or gloves with a washcloth or newspaper and let them dry overnight.

Movie title: The Road to El Dorado Movie plot: In Spain 1519, two con artists, Tulio and Miguel, win a map to the legendary City of Gold, El Dorado, in a rigged gambling match. After their con is discovered, the two evade capture and hide aboard one of the ships to be led by HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s to the New World. During the trip, they are caught as stowaways and imprisoned, but manage to break free and take a rowboat with the help of CortÃ©s' horse, Altivo. Later, they land on an unknown shore at the edge of Mexico, and Miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a totem marker near a large waterfall. Believing it to be a dead end, they suddenly encounter a native woman being chased by guards; when the guards see Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as depicted on the totem, they escort them to a secret entrance behind the falls, along with the woman, and into a city truly made of gold, El Dorado. They are brought to the city's elders, kind-hearted Chief Tannabok and wicked high priest Tzekel-Kan. Tzekel-Kan, seeking to seize the city from Tannabok, insists that the two, mistaken as gods, demonstrate their powers. Tulio and Miguel bicker between themselves, while a nearby volcano begins to erupt. When Tulio yells at Miguel to stop pestering him, the volcano suddenly stops erupting, and the citizens take this as proof of their godhood. Celebrations are held, and the pair are given luxurious quarters to stay, along with charge of the woman, Chel. Chel is aware the two are conning the people but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city.

Write a \\"A).\\" movie review (Choose your answer from: A). negative B). positive).","output":"A) Negative Movie Review: The Emoji Movie (2017) Title: A Meltdown of Misplaced Emojis The Emoji Movie, directed by Tony Leondis, premiered in 2017, introducing the world to the fictionalized lives of emojis. With an impressively talented voice cast, featuring T.J. Miller, Anna Faris, James Corden, and Patrick Stewart, expectations were riding high. However, the movie unfortunately suffers from a weak plot, lack of character development, and cringe-worthy humor that falls flat, ultimately leaving audiences utterly disappointed. For a film that aspired to be unique and fresh, The Emoji Movie blatantly rips off elements from several popular animated films, most notably Disney's Wreck-It Ralph and Pixar's Inside Out. The movie revolves around Gene, a \\"meh\\" emoji who struggles to fit in due to his inability to maintain a single emotion. Along with his friends Jailbreak and Hi-5, Gene embarks on a journey to find his true emotion and purpose. While this concept has potential, the plot becomes gruesomely predictable and brimming with numerous plot holes. The film attempts to deliver a message about individuality, self-acceptance, and how it's okay to be different. However, this message is constantly obscured by the overwhelming product placement scattered throughout. Furthermore, the connection between the characters and the audience simply isn't there. It's challenging for viewers to genuinely care about the problems emojis face, resulting in a largely disconnected experience. Additionally, the movie desperately tries to capitalize on popular trends by including famous internet personalities and relying on shallow technology-based humor. Despite the comedy that was intended to have a mass appeal, these jokes come across as glaringly outdated, often causing eye-rolls instead of laughs. A movie about emojis warranted the potential for creating a visually stunning animation. Still, the graphics are lackluster and unimpressive, adding nothing to the film's appeal. The voice cast is undoubtedly talented, but they seem to do very little to salvage the uninspired script. Performances are mediocre, and none of the actors truly shine in their roles. More disheartening is the fact that Sir Patrick Stewart plays a character as flat and uninteresting as the literal poop emoji. In summary, The Emoji Movie is heavily weighed down by its uninspired plot, inability to connect with audiences emotionally, boring visual spectacle, and misguided humor. Although the film had potential to be a heartwarming, imaginative journey delving into the world of technology and interpersonal relationships, it regrettably turns out as a crass, corporate cash-grab with little artistic merit. It's ultimately a major disappointment that left audiences wishing they could press the \\"delete\\" button on this ill-conceived cinematic venture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Naturally, public expenditure should be defined according to criteria that improve productivity and production. The term \\"innovative factor\\" refers to any element or contributor that introduces new ideas, methods, or creations to a certain field. In this context, it appears to be contributing to the development of new European innovations, which could range from technological inventions to groundbreaking strategies in business, science, or any other field.  European innovation refers to the concept of pushing technological boundaries, discovering scientific breakthroughs and developing unique business strategies within the European sphere. History has shown that Europe has a prestigious track record of innovation, with everything from the discovery of gravity, to the invention of the World Wide Web laying claim to European roots.  In the modern day, this innovative impulse is evident in the various European policies and strategies aimed at furthering scientific research and development. Large-scale efforts such as the European Union's Horizon 2020 program showcase this commitment. Horizon 2020's end goal is fostering innovation and research, providing a financial incentive for relevant projects and attempting to remove obstacles that could potentially hinder innovation. The statement's reference to public expenditure should be defined according to criteria that improve productivity and production indicates that the speaker wishes to tie spending not to arbitrary projects or unproven theories, but rather to ideas and initiatives that have demonstrable potential to boost productivity and production based on established criteria.  The terms \\"productivity\\" and \\"production\\" are integral concepts within the field of economics and business. Productivity refers to the efficiency of production, or how much output you can get from each unit of input. When productivity is high, more goods and services are produced for the same amount of work. This generally leads to increased profits and economic growth. Production, on the other hand, quite simply refers to the process of creating goods and services. When referencing economic expenditures, the intent would be to make sure that decisions for spending public money are guided by the potential to turn that expenditure into increased productivity and production, therefore yielding the maximum benefit from that investment. This philosophy of prudent expenditure is an important one, particularly in the context of public monies. It emphasizes an approach that focuses not just on quantity of expenditure, but quality as well, driving governmental bodies to prioritize projects that promise concrete returns and sustainable growth.

What Does a Stronger Economy Mean for Your Career Plans As 2014 came to a close there were a number of indications that the New Year promised a much stronger economic climate. Among the key positive developments: inflation is currently at is lowest level in six years; the stock market closed the year with an overall growth rate of nearly 10%; the price of oil dropped significantly; the unemployment rate fell to 5.8%; 2014 had the strongest job growth in the past 15 years; and there is strong evidence of overall wage growth and an increase in hiring. This is great news for the active job seeker, but what does it mean for the currently employed professional? Should you take advantage of a stronger economy and look for a new job? A strong economic and labor force environment tends to cause more job shifts but before deciding to search for a new job it’s important to do a “self check in” and determine your motivation for and commitment to making a potentially significant job change. That “self check in” should include answering for yourself some key questions: No doubt you have heard of the 80/20 rule and some would argue that if you are satisfied 80% of the time with your current job, then there is no real reason to consider a change. I would argue instead that you should aim to be happy at work at least 90% of the time. If you are unhappy 20% of the time that easily equates to one full day out of your workweek and why should you settle for that? Of course potential job dissatisfaction comes from a wide variety of sources – working conditions, compensation, colleagues and supervisors are among the most common reasons workers cite in leaving their current jobs – but the nature and extent of dissatisfaction can be uniquely personal. Don’t underestimate the important linkage between your work and personal goals. Before considering a potential job change analyze the pros and cons not only about your job, but also of the things that are important to your life outside of work. Family, friends and lifestyle are enormously important and you want to make sure that any new situation you consider can provide you with better opportunities to achieve both the personal and professional goals you seek. Even a strong economy is not forgiving of the lazy job seeker so if you decide a job change is warranted prepare to put in the necessary work. Researching leads, completing applications, going through the interviewing and selection process – never mind the actual logistics of changing jobs and perhaps homes, schools, and lifestyles – takes time, effort and skill. While it is always better to look for a job while currently employed, it still takes a personal investment and sometimes your current job can make that challenging. Before you make the final decision to consider a job change make sure that you have exhausted all the avenues open to you at your current job to address the issues that might be motivating you to consider a change. Sometimes positive change only requires a thoughtful and evidence based proposal to your current employer to reconsider compensation, job responsibilities and assignments, or enhanced professional development opportunities. So many people skip this step, but if an employer knows that you are a strong performer, they won’t want to lose you, especially since replacing a professional usually costs an employer an average of four times the salary they are paying given lost productivity and recruitment costs. Make sure that when you are ready to begin your job search that you have a number of tools and clearly defined strategies in place. These should include a resume that focuses on accomplishments and quantifies success whenever possible; your LinkedIn profile should not only provide a summary of your experiences and skills, but be geared to the positions you are seeking to move into and contain endorsements and recommendations from a variety of individuals in your network. It’s also a good time to reach out to former employers, colleagues and other contacts through LinkedIn and other sources, who may be able to connect you to professionals with opportunities. If your job search involves moving into a different industry or field, be prepared to discuss your skills and experiences in a way that demonstrates their relevance and be prepared to provide examples that can really showcase what you can bring to an organization. Increasingly employers are using phone and virtual interviews to screen candidates. Be sure to prepare for these as rigorously as you would any in person interview as you need to make a strong and positive impression that will advance you to the next phase of the interview process. This will be especially important if you are looking for positions in a different geographic location. Once you do receive offers, make sure to negotiate for the compensation and extras you want and that motivated you to look for a new position. Be clear, for example, about performance evaluations and future salary raises, bonus structure, coverage for relocation expenses and additional benefits. What ever you agree upon, be sure to get it in writing before you formally accept. Remember that negotiation is always the most effective when you have information so utilize Payscale.com, LinkedIn, and the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, among many other sources, to educate yourself about compensation levels and other comparable insights on the jobs you are considering. The prospect of a new job can be exciting and stimulating and a stronger economic environment makes the prospect even more enticing. Whether you decide to stay put or consider something different, this is an excellent opportunity for self-reflection and discovery and perhaps a New Year’s resolution to move forward personally and professionally in a new direction.

The Pakistan Army carries out a relief and rescue operation in Chitral.      Authorities fear more monsoon rains will bring further disaster this week.      The death toll hit 41 in the Chitral district in far northeast Pakistan by the Afghanistan border, where 23 people are reported missing, said Kyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) provincial disaster management authority spokesman Latif Ur Rehman. The region is susceptible to flash floods.      The National Disaster Management Authority has predicted monsoon rains in the days ahead.      The torrential rain hit the village of Ursoo Saturday evening, where at least 16 people died when flood waters deluged a mosque, Rehman said.      The Pakistan Army rescues flood victims by helicopter in the Chitral region.      Worshipers were offering taraweeh, the extra prayer performed by Sunni Muslims at night during Ramadan, he said.      Efforts by the Pakistani Army and rescue workers were hobbled because the flood hit at night, Rehman said.      On Sunday the Pakistan Army announced via Facebook that troops were engaged in a relief and rescue operation in Chitral, providing food, tents and medical aid.

Mosques, several houses and an army post in Ursoon village in the southwest of Chitral district in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province faced extensive damage after incessant rain caused flash floods early on Sunday.      Chitral is in the far north of Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan's Badakhshan province.      \\"Most bodies had been identified, however, some bodies might have been washed away to Afghanistan,\\" Osama Ahmad Warraich, deputy commissioner of Chitral, told Al Jazeera, before adding that eight of the dead were soldiers.      Eighty-two homes in Ursoon were affected by the waters, a rescue services statement said, with some of them swept away, along with a mosque and an army post.      \\"Sixteen of the dead were offering prayers in the mosque when it was swept away by the flood,\\" spokesperson for the provincial disaster management authority Latifur Rehman said.      The army has been taking part in rescue operations in the affected areas together with the district administration.      But Warraich said the bad weather was hampering rescue efforts, but added that authorities had \\"called for helicopters to join rescue operations\\" in the area.      In April, rains and landslides killed at least 127 people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan region and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.      Poorly-built homes across the country, particularly in rural areas, are susceptible to collapse during the annual spring and monsoon rains in July and August, which are often heavy.      During the rainy season last summer, torrential downpours and flooding killed at least 81 people and affected almost 300,000 people across Pakistan.      The worst flooding in recent times occurred in 2010, which covered almost a fifth of the country's total land mass, killing nearly 2,000 people and displacing some 20 million. ||||| Flash floods, landslides kill at least 50 people in Pakistan, India, officials say      Updated      Flash floods and landslides have killed at least 50 people in northern Pakistan and northern India, officials say.      Key points: At least 43 killed in remote Pakistani village      More than 40 feared dead in India's Uttarakhand state      Thousands believed to be stranded in India      At least 43 people were killed in Pakistan, most in a remote village that did not receive an evacuation warning before flash floods hit, washing away most of the settlement, officials said.      The heavy monsoon rains began late on Saturday and were concentrated mainly in the north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which has been badly affected by flooding in recent years that some scientists have linked to climate change.      The worst-hit district was Chitral, on the country's north-west border with Afghanistan, where the flood waters killed 41 people in the village of Ursoon near the Afghan border, which is home to some 100 families, district mayor Maghfirat Shah said.      Eighty-two homes in the village were affected by the waters, a rescue services statement said, with some of them swept away, along with a mosque and an army post.      \\"Sixteen of the dead were offering prayers in the mosque when it was swept away by the flood,\\" said Latifur Rehman, a spokesman for the provincial disaster management authority.      At least eight of the victims were soldiers, and another eight bodies were swept over the border into Afghanistan, senior local official Osama Waraich said.      Mr Rehman said a military-led rescue and relief operation had begun, with helicopters being used to reach the affected people and provide them with tents, food and medical aid.      Separately, two Chinese engineers were killed and five Pakistani workers injured when the heavy rains caused the roof of a construction site to collapse at Tarbela Dam, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Mr Rehman said.      Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's office issued a statement expressing his grief.      At least 40 feared dead in India landslides      Meanwhile, at least 40 people were feared dead following a downpour that triggered flash floods and landslides in India's northern Uttarakhand state over the weekend, a state official said.      Several more people were still missing, a spokesman at the state chief minister's office, Om Prakash Sati, said on Sunday, with remote Chamoli and Pithoragarh being worst affected districts in the state.      The state has so far confirmed 18 deaths, of whom 15 were from Pithoragarh. The official toll was expected to rise.      Thousands were feared stranded as landslides blocked hundreds of roads. State authorities asked people in low-lying areas to evacuate as a precautionary measure.      Relief operations have begun, but incessant rains have hampered efforts and raised fears of flooding as rivers were close to their danger levels, Mr Sati said.      \\"There is no need to panic,\\" Uttarakhand's chief minister Harish Rawat told reporters, adding more teams from the state central authorities and other relief forces had all been kept on high alert as a precautionary measure.      Several damaged roads have also been repaired, Mr Rawat said.

Adverse drug reactions are appreciably harmful or unpleasant reactions resulting from an intervention related to the use of medical products, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product. Given medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE, the task is to classify whether the case report mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. Classify your answers into non-adverse drug event and adverse drug event. As NBD-Cl has not been reported as an allergen before, the characteristics of this chemical and its use as an analytical reagent are briefly surveyed. Output:","output":"The task is asking you to determine if a medical case report mentions any adverse drug reactions. You will receive medical case reports from MEDLINE and have to classify the reports under two categories: \\"non-adverse drug event\\" and \\"adverse drug event\\".  Here's a simple breakdown of the steps to take: 1. Read the medical case report provided. 2. Look for any information about harmful or unpleasant reactions resulting from the use of medical products. 3. Check if the report predicts hazard from future administration and discusses any preventive measures, specific treatments, dosage regimen alterations, or product withdrawals related to the reaction. 4. If the report meets the criteria mentioned in step 3, classify it as \\"adverse drug event\\". If it doesn't, classify it as \\"non-adverse drug event\\". Now, let's apply these steps to the given input: Medical case report: \\"As NBD-Cl has not been reported as an allergen before, the characteristics of this chemical and its use as an analytical reagent are briefly surveyed.\\" 1. Read the report. 2. The report states that NBD-Cl has not been reported as an allergen before. 3. There is no mention of harm or precautionary actions related to adverse drug reactions in the report. 4. Since no adverse drug reactions were mentioned or discussed, classify this case report as \\"non-adverse drug event\\". Output: non-adverse drug event"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food. These mountains are ours.\\" \\"Your food?\\" Patch asked, bewildered. There was no ownership of food in the Center Kingdom, not until it had actually been eaten. \\"That's ridiculous. It's food. It belongs to whoever finds it first.\\" \\"Then you belong to us,\\" Snout hissed. \\"Because we are the rats who will suck the marrow from your broken bones.\\" According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

The 'business' mentioned is not clearly defined, but it's clear the person in the seventies does it for the 'thrill of the chase'. Interpretation of 'the chase' here could be different; however, a generally safe bet here is to treat it as a metaphor about striving for goals or overcoming challenges. The speaker's question \\"you like being on the run?\\" suggests they mistakenly interpreted 'the chase' as evading or running from something.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"If we examine the two sentences closely, we can see that there is a contradiction between the information presented. Sentence 1 states that there is a huge chemical database, while Sentence 2 directly contradicts this claim, asserting that there is only a small chemical database. In order to determine whether the second sentence holds true if the first sentence is accurate, we must analyze the relationship between the two statements. When examining Sentence 1, it seems the speaker is describing their work with air modeling, specifically for the Dallas area. They mention having a weather station that collects information related to temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and housing a huge chemical database. This large chemical database would likely be utilized for air quality analysis, pollutant tracking, and forecasting purposes to better understand the air conditions within the region. On the other hand, Sentence 2 makes a contrasting claim about the size of the chemical database. By stating that there isn't a huge chemical database, but just a small one, the speaker could be intending to revise or clarify their previous statement, or it could be an entirely different perspective from another person. Given the information provided, if we assume that Sentence 1 is true and that there is a huge chemical database, then the content of Sentence 2 would not be accurate since it negates the existence of a large chemical database. The contradiction can potentially be resolved if we had additional context or clarification on either statement's source, intention, or changes between the times when the two statements were made.

The credit portion of the Financial crisis of 2007-2010 did not affect the Czech Republic much, mostly due to its stable banking sector which has learned its lessons during a smaller crisis in the late 1990s and became much more cautious. As a fraction of the GDP, the Czech public debt is among the smallest ones in Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, unlike many other post-communist countries, an overwhelming majority of the household debt - over 99% - is denominated in the local Czech currency. That's why the country wasn't affected by the shrunken money supply in the U.S. dollars. However, as a large exporter, the economy was sensitive to the decrease of the demand in Germany and other trading partners. In the middle of 2009, the annual drop of the GDP for 2009 was estimated around 3% or 4.3%, a relatively modest decrease. The impact of the economic crisis may have been limited by the existence of the national currency that temporarily weakened in H1 of 2009, simplifying the life of the exporters. Answer this question: Which had a smaller effect on the Chech Republic, the credit portion of the crisis of exporting?","output":"The smaller effect on the Czech Republic during the Financial crisis of 2007-2010 was the credit portion of the crisis. The Czech Republic's stable banking sector, which had learned from a previous crisis in the late 1990s, played a key role in mitigating the impact of the credit crisis. The cautious nature of the banking sector at that time ensured that there was minimal exposure to risky investments and lending practices. In addition, over 99% of the household debt in the Czech Republic was denominated in the local Czech currency, which further insulated the country from the effects of the shrunken money supply in U.S. dollars. This is a crucial factor that protected the Czech economy from the credit crisis, as they did not suffer from the currency fluctuations and tight credit conditions that affected many other countries during that time. On the other hand, the Czech Republic, being a significant exporter, was sensitive to the decrease in demand from Germany and other trading partners. This did have a notable impact on the country's overall economic performance, with the GDP dropping around 3% to 4.3% in 2009, which is considered a relatively modest decrease compared to other countries in the region. However, the existence of their own national currency, which temporarily weakened in the first half of 2009, did provide some relief to the exporters, as it made their products relatively cheaper and more competitive in the international market. In summary, the credit portion of the crisis had a smaller effect on the Czech Republic than the decrease in export demand due to their stable banking sector, a majority of household debt denominated in the local currency, and the temporary weakening of the national currency that supported their exporters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kyle needed a graphics card for their computer while Donald's card was up to date, so  Choose from: A. Kyle  did not need to buy one online.. B. Donald  did not need to buy one online..","output":"B. Donald did not need to buy one online. While Kyle desperately scoured the internet to find a suitable graphics card for his computer, Donald couldn't help but feel grateful that his card was still up to date. He knew how frustrating it could be to search for the perfect card, weighing the pros and cons, and wanting to make the most of his hard-earned money. As Donald sat on his comfortable leather gaming chair, he recalled the experience he had when he first purchased his high-end graphics card about six months ago. Back then, he was obsessed with gaming performance and needed to play all the latest titles at max settings without any compromise. He spent weeks researching and reading countless reviews on tech websites and forums, comparing specs, and benchmarking different graphics cards' performances. Finally, he decided on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080, a beast of a card that would allow him to play games at 4K resolution while still achieving a smooth gaming experience. On the other hand, Kyle was overwhelmed with the number of options available in the market. He was not exactly a tech-savvy person and did not have a clear idea of what specifications mattered the most while selecting a graphics card. The more he researched, the more confused he became. Donald realized that Kyle could use his help and offered to lend a hand in the search for the perfect graphics card. Together, they created a list of requirements based on Kyle's needs and budget. After filtering through numerous options, they narrowed it down to two potential cards: the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT. Both had their merits, and while the NVIDIA card seemed to have a slight performance edge, the AMD card offered a more affordable price point. As they debated the merits of each card, Kyle gave it some thought and ultimately realized that since most of his time was spent on graphic design work and some light gaming, he didn't need the absolute top-of-the-line card. The AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT would be more than enough to suit his needs, and he appreciated the extra money he'd save by going with that option. Once the decision was made, Kyle ordered the AMD card, eagerly waiting for it to arrive so he could start enjoying improved performance on his computer. Donald couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment, knowing that he was able to help his friend make an informed choice and ultimately save money in the process. As they waited for the graphics card to arrive, Donald shared his knowledge of tweaking and optimizing graphic settings with Kyle, so he could get the most out of his new hardware. They spent hours fine-tuning in-game settings, experimenting with different combinations to achieve the perfect balance between performance and visual quality. When the graphics card finally arrived, Kyle excitedly opened the packaging, meticulously reading and following the installation instructions. With Donald's assistance, everything went smoothly, and they successfully installed the new card in Kyle's computer. Upon turning the computer on and launching the first game, Kyle was immediately blown away by the level of performance and detail he could now achieve. With Donald's guidance, they further tweaked the settings, ensuring that Kyle got the absolute best experience possible. In the end, Donald didn't need to buy a new graphics card online, but he gained immense satisfaction from helping his friend Kyle navigate the process, make a well-informed decision, and optimize the performance of his new hardware. Their friendship deepened as they bonded over their shared interest and experiences, leaving both of them grateful for having each other's support in their tech endeavours."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Building a foundation for your child of family values may not be as easy as you think. Often we believe that our child will pick up on our values if they live in the same home. While they may pick up many of our values, parents need to remember they are not the only influence in their child's life. These outside values often compete with family values for your child's attention. If we do not make a conscious  effort to _ our children, they may not get instilled at all. I wish I had learned that lesson a little earlier. I thought if I lived my values for my children they would pick them up and make their own. Sometimes this happened and sometimes it didn't. I often see twenty-something \\"kids\\" who have no faith in many of the values of their family in favor of the values of their friends. Children will often pick up the negative you show quicker than the positive, so the positive things need extra focus to set them. Some of the influences your children face every day include their church, their school, their friends, any clubs or sporting groups they are part of and more. Kids spend many hours a day at school and with their friends. Sometimes in the business of life, we suppose our children will obtain that foundation we want for them. Instilling a foundation of family values to sustain  your child requires more than living it in front of them.

He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948).

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Eric Hahn thought his financial situation was set after he was approved for a private student loan with an 8 percent interest rate to supplement his federal education loans.  Eric Hahn, 21, estimates he will be in debt for the next five to seven years for his undergraduate tuition.  Just a few weeks later, Hahn, 21, was forced to cash in his savings and investments so he could make his rent and tuition after finding out that the lender, MyRichUncle.com, had suspended its private student loan program.  \\"Due to continued disruptions in the capital markets, combined with the continued demand we have experienced this year, we are reaching funding capacity limits,\\" a message on his cell phone said, mimicking a statement on the company's Web site.  The sudden news left Hahn, a senior-year finance major, scrambling to find additional funding after maxing out his borrowing options from the federal government. Eventually, the country's leading student loan provider, Sallie Mae, approved him for a private loan at 12 percent.  After he graduates, Hahn estimates it will take him anywhere from five to seven years to repay about 30,000 he will have borrowed by then.  \\"Money isn't cheap,\\" said Hahn, who transferred to Georgia State University in Atlanta from the University of Connecticut last year because the tuition was less expensive. \\"The process is time-consuming, and there's also the stress of having to liquidate my investments and wonder where I'm going to find money.\\"  About 8 percent of student borrowers rely on private loans, which tend to be costlier and stricter than federal loans, said Robert Shierman, executive director of the Institute for College Access and Success.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? . Turn off your television and your cell phone, and eliminate other external distractions. Use a space in which you feel comfortable and free from the need to complete tasks and other stressors. Set aside designated time to meditate, preferably between twenty minutes and a couple hours, depending on your abilities and preferences.  Wear comfortable clothes that are suitable for your space’s temperature. You’ll want to avoid being distracted by stiff clothing or by being too hot or too cold. Don’t allow birds chirping, cars driving by, and other unavoidable external sounds to interrupt your meditation. Being aware of the world and its interconnections can actually be beneficial to meditation. However, if you live in a location, such as by a subway stop or train track, where noise is dominating your thoughts, you should consider putting on music or a mantra recording, both of which are available on Youtube and other services. To eliminate stiffness and tension in your body as you sit still to meditate, you should stretch yourself out before beginning. Take a few minutes before meditating to stretch your legs, hips, back, shoulders, and neck.  While sitting, hold your legs out straight in front of you and reach for your toes to stretch your calves and hamstrings. Bend your knees while seated and bring the soles of your feet together to stretch your hips and quadriceps. Typically, one sits in a seated, cross-legged position when they meditate. Do so only if it’s comfortable for you to sit cross-legged for an extended period of time, and hold your back upright, unbowed but not unnaturally straight. However, consider sitting in a chair or with your back braced by a wall or other object if you are unable to sit cross-legged without discomfort.  Remember it's important to wear comfortable clothes that allow you to sit still for a while. You will want to avoid distractions from tension or stiffness in your body. Especially if you are just beginning to practice meditation, it is most important to find a distraction-free, comfortable body position. Sit on a yoga mat, a cushion, or on folded blankets or towels for more comfort. Begin your meditation with controlled breathing techniques. Be conscious of your breathing and use each breath you take to focus your intention. Breathe in slowly as you count to four, hold for four, and exhale for four. Let your awareness on your breath help you clear your mind and focus your concentration.  As you inhale, consider light flowing through your essence, as life rises through your vertebrae and fills you.  Imagine the energy-filled center at the point where your in-breath fuses with your out-breath.  As you exhale and your breath is out completely, visualize a universal pause in which your particular self vanishes and focus on your interconnectedness with everything around you.","output":"This article provides detailed guidance on creating a comfortable, distraction-free environment, preparing your body, and using controlled breathing techniques for an effective and mindful meditation practice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sadly, not everyone in these countries is so fortunate and many people in rich countries are homeless. The reasons for homelessness are various, but poverty is undoubtedly one of the main causes. The homeless people may have become jobless and then been unable to pay their rent and so no longer have _ . Often, the fact that unemployed people get help from the government prevents this from happening, but not always. Some homeless people are mentally ill and have no one to look after them. Some are young people who, for one reason or another, have left home and have nowhere to live. Many of them have had a serious disagreement with their parents and have left home, choosing to go to a city and live on the streets. Sometimes they have taken such action because they have been unable to get on with a step-parent. Many homeless people get into the habit of begging to get enough money to stay alive, but many of the general public refuse to give anything to beggars. Often they are moved on by the police, being accused  ,whether rightly or wrongly, of forceful begging . There are many who disrespect homeless people. Some cynics declare that homeless people choose to live the life which they lead. But who would willingly choose to live in a shop doorway, under a bridge or in a cardboard box?

Write an article based on this \\"There has been a lack of effective monitoring of a grant designed to help some of lowest achieving children in Wales, the assembly's influential education committee has warned.\\"","output":"Title: Inadequate Monitoring of Educational Grants in Wales: Impeding Support for Low Achieving Children Step 1: Provide an introduction to the issue In this first paragraph, I will introduce the topic by mentioning the problem of ineffective monitoring of a significant educational grant in Wales and its impact on the country's lowest achieving children. Introduction: Wales, despite its ambitious goals to improve educational opportunities, has encountered recent hurdles in the form of insufficient monitoring of a crucial grant designed for its most vulnerable students. The Welsh Assembly's influential education committee has expressed concerns and warnings regarding this ongoing issue. Step 2: Explain the purpose of the grant In the second paragraph, I will explain the intention behind the grant and why it is essential in helping low achieving children in Wales. The grant in question, known for targeting the lowest achievers, aims to narrow the gap between their performance and that of their peers. By providing financial assistance and resources, the grant seeks to deliver improvements in their educational trajectories and, subsequently, their future prospects. Step 3: Detail the education committee's concerns and findings In this paragraph, I will delve deeper into the specific concerns raised by the education committee, including instances or evidence of inadequate monitoring. Highlighted by the education committee, the lack of effective monitoring has left stakeholders in the dark about whether the grant is positively affecting the intended beneficiaries or not. The committee has urged the Welsh government to promptly and thoroughly evaluate its administration of the grant, measure its impact on students' performance, and transparently share the results with involved parties.  Step 4: Discuss the implications of poor monitoring In this section, I will examine the potential consequences of inadequately monitoring this educational grant on affected children, schools, and the Welsh education system as a whole. Should the Welsh government fail to address the issue of insufficient monitoring, the effectiveness of the grant could continue to be undermined. Consequently, the intended benefits for the lowest achieving children may never be fully realized. Moreover, lack of transparency and evaluation might lead to a further mistrust of the educational system among parents, teachers, and administrators. Step 5: Suggest potential solutions or recommendations Finally, I will propose possible resolutions to the problem and recommend ways to enhance the monitoring process. To safeguard the purpose and success of this essential grant, the Welsh government needs to reassess its monitoring and oversight mechanisms. Collaborating more closely with schools, teachers, and local authorities could help develop better evaluative tools and improved strategies for tracking progress. Additionally, dedicating resources to promote transparency would allow parents and stakeholders to better understand the impact of the grant, which in turn encourages accountability. Conclusion: The future of Welsh children, particularly those struggling academically, depends heavily on their access to effective support systems. Addressing the current inadequacy in monitoring the educational grant is a critical step in ensuring that the most vulnerable students in Wales receive the necessary resources to succeed. As highlighted by the education committee, it is incumbent upon the Welsh government to take prompt action for a more transparent and successful grant administration and, ultimately, a brighter future for its young citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated. A later tradition recorded his entry into Jerusalem: according to Josephus, Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel's prophecy, presumably chapter 8, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. He spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt. However, Alexander met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When \\"his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt\\". After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery. Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC, where he was regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his..., can you guess it ?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm?  Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms.  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be deduced that Kenny will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm. The reasoning behind this conclusion is as follows: 1. Bobby has recently received a large order of potatoes, which has resulted in him increasing the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. The increased use of fertilizer means that more nitrogen, an element found in fertilizers, will seep into the soil. 2. On the other hand, Kenny is growing tomatoes, which are not in season right now. This means that his use of fertilizer is currently low, and consequently, the amount of nitrogen released into the soil is also lesser than that of Bobby's farm. 3. As the hint explains, rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away. This means that the large amount of rain falling on both farms will dissolve the fertilizer, and nitrogen will be washed away into the ponds located downstream from both farm sites. 4. Since there is more nitrogen in the water, it causes algae to grow out of control. With a higher concentration of nitrogen in Bobby's fertilizer runoff due to his increased fertilizer usage, there is a higher likelihood of excessive algae growth in the ponds near his farm. 5. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water, creating a dead zone. Again, since there is more nitrogen from Bobby's farm, the dead zones around his farm would likely be more severe. In conclusion, Kenny, with his currently low use of fertilizer, will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm compared to Bobby, whose increased fertilizer usage due to the large potato order contributes to higher nitrogen levels and more severe dead zones in the nearby ponds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Marron Glacé is what, preserved and coated in sugar????","output":"Marron Glacé, a French delicacy, refers to a chestnut (marron) that has been preserved in sugar syrup and then coated with a layer of sugar glaze. It is both a popular sweet treat and a versatile ingredient used in various desserts and confections. Marron Glacé is enjoyed throughout Europe, particularly in France and Italy, during the Christmas season and other festive occasions. To understand the process of making a Marron Glacé, let's break down the steps involved: 1. Selecting and preparing the chestnuts: The first step involves hand-picking and selecting premium quality chestnuts. Large, plump, and fresh chestnuts are typically chosen for their sweet and intense flavor. The chestnuts are then washed and lightly scored (a small incision made at the top) to ease the peeling process after cooking. 2. Blanching and peeling: The chestnuts are blanched in boiling water, which helps to soften their shells and inner skins. It is essential to carefully peel the chestnuts while still warm, as this ensures that the inner skin is removed without damaging the tender nut inside. 3. Preparing the sugar syrup: A sugar syrup is prepared by boiling water and sugar together, often with an additional flavoring ingredient such as vanilla beans. The syrup's concentration may vary depending on the desired sweetness and consistency of the final Marron Glacé. 4. Candying process: The chestnuts are submerged in the sugar syrup and gently cooked over low heat for an extended time, commonly several days, while being periodically stirred. This slow process allows the sugar syrup to penetrate and preserve the chestnuts, making them tender and full of flavor. The candying process may also involve multiple cycles of simmering and resting the chestnuts in the syrup to achieve the desired texture. 5. Drying and glazing: Once the chestnuts have absorbed the maximum amount of sugar syrup, they are removed from the syrup and laid out onto a cooling rack or tray to drain and dry for a couple of hours or even up to a day. When the chestnuts are adequately dried, they get a final coat of sugar glaze, which can be made by simply reducing and thickening the reserved sugar syrup or by using a water and sugar mixture known as fondant. 6. Optional final touches: Some producers may choose to add a finishing touch to the Marron Glacés by dipping them in chocolate or dusting them with cocoa powder. Marron Glacé can be enjoyed on its own as a luxurious confection or utilized in numerous dessert recipes, such as Mont Blanc (a chestnut and whipped cream dessert), ice creams, tarts, or incorporated into cakes and pastries. Overall, Marron Glacé is a sophisticated and delightful treat that showcases the exquisite flavor of chestnuts in a delectable, candied form. The delicate and labor-intensive process of crafting Marron Glacé is what contributes to its prized status as a gourmet indulgence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit.  Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling.  In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water.  Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling.  The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure.  Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises.  This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible.  Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water.  A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems.  A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks.

It was developed by the Russell family in the 17th and 18th centuries into a fashionable residential area. It is notable for its array of garden squares, literary connections (exemplified by the Bloomsbury Group), and numerous cultural, educational and health-care institutions. Although Bloomsbury was not the first area of London to have acquired a formal square, Bloomsbury Square, laid out in 1660 by Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, as Southampton Square was the first square to be named as such. Much of the district was planned and built by James Burton.  - Herodotus (\\"Hródotos\\") was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (484 425 BC), a contemporary of Socrates. He is widely referred to as \\"The Father of History\\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \\"The Histories\\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \\"inquiry\\" (or \\"historía\\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate; yet he states that he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information. Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history.  - Assyria was a major Mesopotamian East Semitic-speaking kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East. It existed as an independent state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC in the form of the Assur city-state, until its lapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age.  - Reign. Astyages succeeded his father in 585 BCE, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuchadnezzar was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. but due to the recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to seal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Median throne upon his father's death later that year.  - Rusa II was king of Urartu between around 680 BC and 639 BC. It was during his reign that the massive fortress complex, Karmir-Blur, was constructed.  - Cyaxares (\\"Uvaxštra\\", , ; r. 625585 BC), the son of King Phraortes, and according to Herodotus was the third and most capable king of Media. According to Herodotus, Cyaxares, grandson of Deioces, had a far greater military reputation than his father or grandfather. He was the first to divide his troops into separate sections of spearmen, archers, and horsemen.  - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.  - Rusa III was king of Urartu . He was called \`\` Son of Erimena , '' meaning that he was probably a brother of Rusa II. Little is known about his reign ; his name was inscribed on a massive granary at Armavir and on a series of bronze shields from the temple of Khaldi found at Rusahinili , now held in the British Museum . According to the Armenian historian Moses of Chorene , Rusa 's father Erimena can probably be identified with Paruyr Skayordi , who helped the Median king Cyaxares to conquer Assyria , for which Cyaxares recognized him as the king of Armenia , although the Medes ultimately reneged on this ; significantly later , during the reign of King Astyages , the Medes conquered and annexed Armenia . Rusa was the father of Sarduri IV.  - Aššur (Akkadian; 'shr; : shr : shr, Kurdish Asûr), also known as Ashur and Qal'at Sherqat, was an Assyrian city, capital of the Old Assyrian Empire (20251750 BC), Middle Assyrian Empire (13651050 BC), and for a time, the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911605 BC). The remains of the city are situated on the western bank of the Tigris River, north of the confluence with the tributary Little Zab River, in modern-day Iraq, more precisely in the Al-Shirqat District in the Saladin Governorate.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016.

Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history.  - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south.

It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Urartu, also known as Kingdom of Van (Urartian: ' Assyrian: '; Babylonian: \\"Urashtu\\"), was an Iron Age kingdom centred on Lake Van in the Armenian Highlands. It corresponds to the biblical \\"Kingdom of Ararat\\".  - The Medes (Old Persian \\"\\", ) were an ancient Iranian people who lived in an area known as Media (northwestern Iran) and who spoke the Median language.

The school, though, is owned by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot), and Delassalle flaunts his relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), a teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface, and Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained.Nicole sees in the paper that the police found the corpse. Christina goes to the morgue and learns it is not Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He gets involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin.When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says Michel punished him. After hearing this Christina becomes very sick. She is unable to be photographed for the school photo; however, it seems that Michel is in it, in the back next to a window. Nicole becomes worried and leaves the school. Christina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool. Christina hears some noises and wanders the school. She concludes that someone is in the school and she runs back to her room. She finds Michel's corpse in the bathtub.

The two statements share similarities, but they are not identical, and some assumptions need to be made to establish a connection between them. Let's break down the two statements and analyze them in detail to better understand their correlation: 1. \\"Two people flipping into the clean crisp water.\\"  In this statement, the emphasis lies on the water being \\"clean\\" and \\"crisp.\\" The words \\"clean\\" and \\"crisp\\" serve as adjectives that provide additional information about the water's quality. The focus is not just on two people flipping into the water but also on the condition of the water. 2. \\"Two people are flipping into water.\\"  This statement is a more general affirmation, stating that two people are flipping into the water but not offering any information about the water's quality. It could refer to any water body, regardless of whether it is clean and crisp, murky, stagnant, or in any other state. To consider the premise true, we need to ensure that the water being referred to in the second statement is indeed clean and crisp. If we can verify that the water quality is the same in both statements, we can make the assumption that the two statements refer to the same scenario and therefore establish their connection. In summary, the premise \\"Two people flipping into the clean crisp water.\\" can be considered true based on the scenario \\"Two people are flipping into water\\" only if we assume that the water in the latter statement is clean and crisp. Without this assumption, we cannot conclude that the two statements are the same or that one can be true based on the other."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Bill Shankly was born in a small Ayrshire coal mining village, called Glenbuck, whose population in 1913, the year of Shankly's birth, was around 700. People born there would often move to find work in larger coal mines. As a result, Glenbuck became largely derelict and by the time Shankly's ghost writer John Roberts visited it in 1976, there were only 12 houses left, including a cottage owned by Shankly's sister, Elizabeth, whom Roberts described as \\"the last of the children of Glenbuck\\". Shankly's parents, John and Barbara, lived in one of the Auchenstilloch Cottages with their 10 children; five boys and five girls. Shankly had a single season, 1932-33, at Carlisle United, then relatively new to the Football League and playing in the Third Division North, their reserve side playing in the North Eastern League. Shankly was recommended by a scout called Peter Carruthers who had seen him playing for Cronberry. He was invited for a month's trial and said it was the first time he had left Scotland. He was signed after just one trial match for Carlisle's reserves against Middlesbrough reserves, even though Carlisle reserves lost the match 6-0. A local newspaper report said that \\"Shankly played strenuously and might develop into a useful left back\\" but, in fact, he developed into a top-class right-half.  Shankly made his senior debut on 31 December 1932 in a 2-2 draw against Rochdale and made 16 appearances for the first team. At the end of the season, the reserves won the North Eastern League Cup, defeating Newcastle United reserves 1-0 in the final. In his 1976 autobiography, Shankly stated: \\"I've still got the medal\\".  At this stage of his career, Shankly was assessed as \\"a hard running, gritty right-half\\" whose displays brought him much praise and credit and he was \\"earmarked as a key young player capable of taking Carlisle on to greater things\\". He was paid four pounds ten shillings a week at Carlisle which he considered a good wage as the top rate at that time was eight pounds. Shankly was happy at Carlisle which was close to his home at Glenbuck and he had settled in well with almost a guarantee of first team football.

The process of frying pickles and onion rings, while similar, does have a few key differences that can make the preparation and the frying experience quite distinct. In this case, the pickles were easier for Mike to handle, making the task less frustrating for him. There are a few factors that could contribute to this difference: 1. Preparation: Preparing pickles for frying involves relatively fewer steps than preparing onion rings. For pickles, one simply needs to slice them and pat them dry before dipping them in batter. On the other hand, onions must be peeled, sliced, and separated into individual rings before they can be battered. This can be time-consuming and complicated, especially if the onion rings are not cut uniformly, or if the outer layers of the onion tend to stick together. 2. Batter consistency: The batter used for frying pickles and onion rings can differ in terms of its consistency and adherence. In some cases, pickles may be more forgiving, allowing the batter to stick better to the pickles than the onion rings. The unique texture of pickles may also help to maintain a crisp exterior once the batter is cooked, while onions can sometimes become mushy and cause the batter to separate as they cook. 3. Frying process: Pickles and onion rings may require different frying times and techniques to achieve the desired level of crispiness. In this scenario, it appears that Mike found the frying process for pickles to be less challenging and more straightforward as compared to onion rings, likely due to the differences in preparation, batter, and the nature of the two ingredients. This led to him feeling annoyed with the onion rings rather than the pickles. 4. Personal preference and experience: Mike's annoyance could also be attributed to his personal preference and experience in frying various ingredients. If he had more practice frying pickles or simply enjoyed the task more, it's likely that the process of frying onion rings would be less enjoyable and more frustrating for him. In conclusion, frying pickles was a lot more simple for Mike than the onion rings, resulting in the onion rings being the source of annoyance for him (Option B). This could be due to factors such as preparation, batter consistency, frying process, and personal experience. Understanding these differences can help explain why Mike found one task more frustrating than the other."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write an article with the title: \\"Tower blocks haven’t only scarred city skylines - they’ve ruined lives\\"","output":"Title: Tower Blocks Haven't Only Scarred City Skylines - They've Ruined Lives Introduction Tower blocks have been a common feature of city skylines throughout the world for decades since the mid-20th century. Conceived as a solution to the housing crisis and urban overcrowding, they have now become a symbol of architectural and social failure for many. This article aims to unveil the harsh realities that residents of tower blocks face and explain how these gigantic concrete structures have not only scarred city skylines but also ruined lives. The Utopian Vision During the mid-20th century, modernist architects such as Le Corbusier dreamt of magnificent, futuristic cities with immense tower blocks providing safe, clean, and comfortable homes for thousands. This utopian vision was quickly adopted by urban planners, resulting in a construction boom of high-rise buildings that promised a better, more organized way of living. However, as time passed, these architectural marvels started revealing their dark side, as they became havens for poverty, crime, and social alienation. Disconnection and Social Alienation One of the main issues with tower blocks is that they disrupt the sense of community that is vital for human wellbeing. Traditional neighborhoods are often built around streets and public spaces, where people can interact and form connections. Tower blocks, on the other hand, with their enclosed corridors and limited communal areas, are designed to maximize the number of living units, but at the expense of human interaction. Residents in these buildings often report a sense of isolation, a feeling of being disconnected from their neighbors and the wider community, which leads to a lower quality of life compared to those living in more traditional structures. This lack of social cohesion can also contribute to high levels of crime, vandalism, and anti-social behavior, further deteriorating the conditions for those living in tower blocks. Design and Maintenance Issues Poor design, construction, and maintenance are common issues that plague tower blocks. Over time, many towers are prone to structural problems like leaking roofs, damp walls, and broken lifts, which not only make life uncomfortable for the residents but also pose serious health hazards. Inadequate insulation leads to higher energy consumption and costs, placing an additional burden on already struggling families. Moreover, the imposing height and narrow windows often create an oppressive atmosphere for those residing in the upper floors of tower blocks, resulting in a lack of natural light and fresh air. Economic and Spatial Segregation The population density within tower blocks creates a stark socio-economic divide within cities that results in clusters of poverty and social deprivation. Over time, these vast concrete structures become synonymous with substandard living conditions and a lack of access to essential services such as education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. This spatial segregation further fuels the cycle of poverty and disenfranchisement among the residents, leaving them with limited chances to break free from their circumstances. Mental Health Impact The combined effect of these factors has a significant impact on the mental health of tower block residents. Studies have shown that individuals living in high-rise buildings are more prone to stress, anxiety, and depression. The lack of green spaces and limited access to nature further exacerbates the negative effects on mental health, as residents are deprived of the calming and restorative benefits of natural environments. Conclusion The grand vision of improved living standards through the development of tower blocks has proven to be a hollow promise. Instead, these imposing structures have scarred not only city skylines but also the lives of those who inhabit them. Now, more than ever, it is crucial for architects, urban planners, and policymakers to reimagine and redesign our urban landscapes to foster community, wellbeing, and inclusivity, so that cities become more than just places to exist, but also places where people can thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What was painted on the top of the train? Title: Hart's War Movie plot: During World War II, U.S. Army intelligence officer First Lieutenant Thomas Hart (Farrell) is captured by German forces. While interrogating Hart, the Germans coerce him to divulge intelligence by taking away his boots, causing his feet to become frostbitten and badly injured, and leaving him, naked, in a very cold cell. He is then transferred by train to Stalag VI-A prisoner of war camp at Hemer, Germany. While en route, a P-51 Mustang attacks (the letters POW were painted on the top of the train, but got covered by thick snow). To save themselves, the POWs leave the train and spell P-O-W with their bodies and prevent further strafing. After arriving at the new POW camp, Lt. Hart is interviewed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it. McNamara knows this to be a lie when Hart says he only endured three days of interrogation. McNamara does not reveal this to Hart, but sends him to bunk in a barracks for enlisted men, rather than allow him to bunk with the other officers. Two black pilots are brought to the camp and assigned to Hart's barracks. They are the only blacks in the camp, and their situation is compounded by their status as officers. Staff Sgt. Vic W. Bedford (Hauser), a racist, is their primary antagonist. One of the pilots, Lt. Lamar Archer, is executed when accused of keeping a weapon that Bedford had planted in his bunk. When Bedford himself subsequently turns up dead, the surviving pilot, Lt. Lincoln A. Scott (Howard) is accused of killing Bedford in retaliation. A law student before the war, Hart is appointed by McNamara to defend the accused pilot at his court-martial, a trial to which the camp commandant, Oberst Werner Visser (IureÅ) agrees. Much later, McNamara reveals to Hart that the \\"defense,\\" like the trial itself, is a sham, an elaborate distraction to hide a planned attack on a nearby ammunition plant (the U.S. Army mistakenly believes it to be a shoe factory) by...

Hypothesis: The local population is hungry.","output":"After reading the paragraph, it is reasonable to believe that the hypothesis stating that the local population is hungry is true. The text mentions that game reserves are facing increasing threats from \\"hungry, poor, and angry local populations.\\" While the other two adjectives \\"poor\\" and \\"angry\\" are also attributed to the local populations, the use of the word \\"hungry\\" specifically implies that there is a lack of adequate food resources in the area. The paragraph outlines that Phinda, a South African-based Conservation Corporation, is promoting a people-based approach to wildlife conservation. This approach is becoming more popular as a response to the escalating issues experienced by local communities, such as scarcity of food, poverty, and anger or frustration. The connection between wildlife conservation efforts and these societal problems suggests that addressing the hunger experienced by the local population may be a key concern in implementing and sustaining effective conservation programs. This hunger that the local population is experiencing may be due to several factors. For instance, the expansion of game reserves may restrict or displace local communities from their traditional sources of food, such as hunting and gathering, or access to arable land for agriculture. Additionally, increased competition for scarce resources may aggravate the problem and exacerbate tensions among locals, which could contribute to the perceived \\"anger\\" mentioned in the text. Furthermore, the conservation efforts led by Phinda and their philosophy of a people-based approach recognize the importance of considering the needs and well-being of the local population while designing their wildlife conservation strategies. In this context, the fact that the local population is hungry indicates that Phinda's approach addresses the problem directly, by incorporating the concerns and interests of these communities within their conservation initiatives. In conclusion, the paragraph strongly suggests that the local population is hungry, as it highlights the escalating threat that game reserves face from hungry, poor, and angry locals. The people-based approach to wildlife conservation promoted by Phinda appears to be a response to these challenges, and recognises that addressing the hunger experienced by the local population is an important element in achieving long-term, sustainable conservation outcomes in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alejo Carpentier y Valmont (December 26, 1904 - April 24, 1980) was a Cuban novelist, essayist, and musicologist who greatly influenced Latin American literature during its famous \\"boom\\" period. Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, Carpentier grew up in Havana, Cuba, and despite his European birthplace, he strongly self-identified as Cuban throughout his life. He traveled extensively, particularly in France, and to South America and Mexico, where he met prominent members of the Latin American cultural and artistic community. Carpentier took a keen interest in Latin American politics and often aligned himself with revolutionary movements, such as Fidel Castro's Communist Revolution in Cuba in the mid-20th century. The Baroque style dates back to the cultural period of the 17th and early 18th centuries. It is most often defined as \\"the dominant style of art in Europe between the Mannerist and Rococo eras, a style characterized by dynamic movement, overt emotion and self-confident rhetoric\\". Carpentier first became fascinated with this style in architecture and sculpture; however, he later describes el barroco as un espiritu, and not un estilo historico (\\"a spirit, not an historical style\\"). Wakefield insists that this attitude towards the Baroque stemmed from Carpentier's background in both Europe and Latin America which allowed him to take on a superior front in the face of post-colonialism and ultimately have the literary upper-hand where he could use European style to tell the Latin American story. Carpentier developed his vision of the baroque in his early works before he described himself as a baroque writer. He experimented with the technique in several developmental stages: \\"first as a cultural style of aesthetic fascination, later as a literary device to create period ambiance, and finally as a weapon of postcolonial pride, defiance and one-upmanship\\".  This style strongly presents itself when comparing works such as the early Ecue-Yamba-O to the celebrated El reino de este mundo, regarding Carpentier's use of more historically eloquent vocabulary in the latter, instead of the authentic language of the ethnically-inspired characters. Here he escapes the stereotype of \\"nativism\\" by incorporating European standards, but continues to achieve a sense of normalcy without the expected use of the colloquialisms which the protagonist Ti Noel would undoubtedly use.  Kaup claims that Carpentier utilizes what is known as the \\"New World Baroque\\", since Latin America didn't come into contact with the Enlightenment or \\"European modernity\\". This contraconquista (counter conquest) allows the New World authors to experiment with new identities and the manners of expressing them. As such, Carpentier observed in his 1975 essay that \\"American Baroque develop[ed] along with criollo culture ...: the awareness of being Other, of being new, of being symbiotic, of being a criollo; and the criollo spirit is itself a Baroque spirit.\\" This criollo of the New World Baroque is often seen as the dominant style of European literature emerging as a subordinate literary construction in Latin America.","output":"This text is about Alejo Carpentier y Valmont, a Cuban novelist, essayist, and musicologist who greatly influenced Latin American literature during its famous \\"boom\\" period. The text also discusses Carpentier's fascination with the Baroque style and its influence on his work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","output":"\\"Sulfas\\" is a colloquial term that generally refers to a group of drugs known as \\"sulfonamide antibiotics.\\" These are synthetic antimicrobial agents that contain a chemical structure called the sulfonamide group. They are often simply called \\"sulfa drugs.\\" Sulfa drugs were the first widely used antibiotics, discovered in the 1930s, and played a significant role in combating bacterial infections before penicillin and other classes of antibiotics were developed. Sulfa drugs work by inhibiting the growth of bacteria by interfering with the bacterial synthesis of folic acid, which is essential for their growth and reproduction. Specifically, they act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, which is involved in the production of folic acid. As the human body doesn't synthesize folic acid and instead obtains it from dietary sources, sulfonamides selectively target bacterial cells without causing significant harm to human cells. Some common examples of sulfa drugs include: 1. Sulfamethoxazole: Often combined with another antibiotic, trimethoprim, in the drug Bactrim or Septra, which is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections including urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, and skin infections. 2. Sulfasalazine: Used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, as well as rheumatoid arthritis. 3. Sulfadiazine: Used to treat Neisseria meningitidis infections and, in combination with pyrimethamine, for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. It's important to note that some people have an allergic reaction to sulfa drugs, which can range from mild skin rashes to more severe symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling, or anaphylactic shock. For these individuals, alternative antibiotics are usually prescribed. In summary, \\"sulfas\\" refers to sulfonamide antibiotics, a class of synthetic antimicrobial agents that are effective against a wide range of bacterial infections. They work by inhibiting bacterial folic acid synthesis, which is essential for bacterial growth and replication. Despite the development of newer antibiotics, sulfa drugs still have a significant role in treating specific infections, especially in individuals who are allergic to other types of antibiotics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Write down all the details about your sunglasses. Evaluate the overall condition of the glasses. Measure your sunglasses. Research similar sunglasses online. Locate anything that came with the glasses.","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Evaluating and Assessing Your Sunglasses Introduction: Sunglasses are more than just a fashionable accessory; they play a crucial role in protecting our eyes from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays and reducing glare. Just like any other personal possession, it's essential to evaluate and assess the overall condition of your sunglasses from time to time. In this article, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide to help you assess your sunglasses, measure them accurately, and compare them with similar models online. 1. Write Down All the Details About Your Sunglasses Begin by listing down all the essential details about your sunglasses. Key factors to include are the brand, model number, the material used for the frames, lens type (polarized or non-polarized, etc.), and any other special features. These details will be beneficial for future reference and help you keep track of your sunglasses' specifications. They will also be helpful when you research similar sunglasses or consider purchasing a new pair. 2. Assess the Overall Condition of the Glasses Next, inspect your sunglasses for signs of wear and damage. Examine the frames for any visible cracks, loose screws, or broken hinges. Check the lenses for scratches, chips, or any form of discoloration. If you notice any distortion in your vision while wearing your sunglasses, it could be a sign of damaged lenses. If there is damage beyond repair, consider investing in a new pair that offers adequate eye protection and meets your fashion preferences. 3. Measure Your Sunglasses To determine if your sunglasses still fit comfortably, measure them by following these simple steps: - Using a ruler or a measuring tape, measure the total width of your sunglasses from one end of the frame to the other. This way, you can ensure they're not too tight or too loose for your face. - Measure the temple size, which is the length of the arm that stretches from the frame to its tip. A correctly fitting pair of sunglasses should have the temples resting comfortably on your ears without causing discomfort. - Check the size of the bridge, which is the space between the lenses above your nose. A properly sized bridge will prevent your sunglasses from sliding down your nose or resting too high on your face. By measuring your sunglasses accurately, you can ensure that they provide the necessary coverage, help in reducing glare, and remain comfortable to wear for extended periods. 4. Research Similar Sunglasses Online Having the above-listed details and measurements of your sunglasses will make it easier to locate and compare similar products online. Researching prices, features, and customer reviews is a great way to evaluate the current market and help you make informed decisions when choosing a new pair of sunglasses. This step can also provide you with insights into the longevity of the specific brand or model you are owning. 5. Locate Anything That Came with the Glasses It is essential to maintain and store your sunglasses correctly. Gather any accessories that came with your sunglasses, such as a cleaning cloth, hard or soft case, warranty information, or any other relevant documentation. Storing your sunglasses in their case will help prevent any accidental damage, while proper cleaning with a microfiber cloth and cleaning solution can extend their lifespan. Keeping all these items together can make evaluating and maintaining your sunglasses significantly more manageable. Conclusion: Evaluating and assessing your sunglasses is crucial to ensure that they continue to serve their purpose of providing essential eye protection and maintaining optimal visual clarity. By following this comprehensive guide, you can gain valuable insights into your sunglasses' condition, understand their specific features, and compare them with similar products in the market. Regular evaluation and proper care will ensure your sunglasses remain in good condition and provide the necessary protection and style for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That means out of all the income generated in Brasilia through the production of goods and services, only a very small portion of that income, specifically 0.2%, is derived from businesses that are engaged in farming or farming-related activities, including businesses that are directly involved in farming as well as businesses that supply goods and services to farmers, such as seed, equipment, and machinery providers, food and fiber processors, marketing firms, and much more. This relatively low percentage could be due to a number of reasons. It could indicate that Brasilia's economy isn't as reliant or focused on agribusiness compared to other sectors, or that other sectors like Public Administration and Services are simply much more dominant in the region. The high percentage of Public Administration at 54.8% could be because Brasilia is the federal capital of Brazil and houses many government agencies and employees. The Services sector at 28.7% is also fairly substantial, reflecting the lifestyle of the city's suburban residents. Industry and Commerce contribute 10.2% and 6.1% respectively. It's also worth noting that these percentages are specific to the time and source they are extracted from. As economic conditions change over time, the contributions of different sectors to GDP may also shift. For a more dynamic perspective, it would be beneficial to look at historical data and trends in the GDP breakdown, or make use of forecasts and predictions based on developed economic models.  Lastly, it's important to remember that the GDP breakdown doesn’t necessarily reflect the economic wellbeing of the residents or the region. For instance, even though Brasilia's agribusiness sector only contributes 0.2% to the GDP, it doesn’t mean it's insignificant or not valuable. Some sectors might be smaller in terms of economic output, but could still be critical for employment, regional identity, or achieving certain environmental or social goals."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial? ?  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

It is not only fun but also offers a multitude of health benefits, making it popular among exercise enthusiasts. If you're looking to start an aerobics routine but don't know where to begin, this ultimate guide will provide you with all the necessary steps to ensure a smooth and fruitful journey towards a healthier you. Step 1: Choosing Your Aerobics Style There are various types of aerobics to choose from, such as low-impact aerobics, water aerobics, step aerobics, and dance aerobics. Take some time to research the different styles and decide which one suits your personal preferences and fitness level best. You may also want to consider participating in group classes or finding online tutorials to give you an idea of what each style entails. Step 2: Setting Aside Time The American Heart Association recommends a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week for adults. To meet this requirement, plan your schedule and set aside enough time for your aerobics sessions. You can break it down into shorter sessions spread throughout the week, such as 30 minutes of exercise five days per week. Step 3: Preparing a Workout Plan Before starting your aerobics routine, pre-prepare a workout plan. This plan should include a warm-up, the main aerobics session, and a cool-down. Your warm-up should consist of 5-10 minutes of gentle exercises to increase your heart rate and prepare your muscles for the main workout. The main session should vary in intensity and include a mix of different moves. Finish off with a cool-down of 5-10 minutes to help bring your heart rate back to normal and stretch your muscles to aid recovery. Step 4: Dress Appropriately Comfort is key when choosing clothes for your aerobics sessions. Wear breathable, moisture-wicking clothes that allow your body to stay cool and dry during the workout. Opt for athletic shoes that provide good arch support and cushioning for your feet, as aerobics can involve a lot of jumping and impact on your joints. Step 5: Clear the Workout Area Ensure you have a large, clear area to perform your aerobics routine. This space should be free of any obstacles that could cause injury during your workout. If you are doing a home workout, move any furniture or items that may be in the way, and consider using a yoga mat or exercise mat for added comfort and support. Step 6: Creating the Perfect Playlist A good workout playlist can help keep you motivated and energized throughout your session. Choose upbeat songs with a consistent rhythm that matches the tempo of your chosen aerobics style. This will make it easier to maintain the rhythm and flow of your movements. Step 7: Stay Hydrated Staying hydrated is essential during any form of exercise. Keep a water bottle handy so that you can easily take sips throughout your workout. Drinking water before, during, and after your session can help replenish lost fluids and prevent dehydration. Conclusion: Starting an aerobics routine can be exciting and rewarding. By following these steps, you can set yourself up for success and enjoy all the benefits aerobic exercise has to offer. Remember to consult with your doctor before beginning any new exercise program, especially if you have any health concerns or pre-existing conditions.

Which year was there a break in the monsoon regime?  2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area,  because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year.  Hint: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] The answer is:","output":"To answer the question, let's break down the information given in the paragraph: 1. 2018 was a wet year for the Four Corners area due to the subtropical ridge. 2. 2019 was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength. 3.

John, upon seeing the ad, comments that he really should go and get a new pair since he is nearsighted and hasn't gotten a new pair of glasses in a couple years. Rick says he is glad that he doesn't need to wear glasses because it seems like such a pain to have to always have something on your face. John nods in agreement and then both men turn to see a woman at the other side of the break room waving at them and trying to get their attention.  and a hint : Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.  Please answer this question : Who is more likely a diabetic?

Article:","output":"Title: Effective Strategies for Responding to Workplace Challenges Introduction In today's fast-paced business environment, workplace challenges are inevitable. Not only do they test your ability to adapt and grow, but they also offer the opportunity to develop valuable problem-solving skills. Addressing these challenges effectively requires clear thinking, empathy, and perseverance. This article discusses various strategies to tackle workplace challenges, including deciding if action is required, talking to colleagues, keeping records, and considering your options. 1. Decide if Action is Required Upon encountering a workplace challenge, your initial reaction might be to jump in and resolve it. Resist this urge and take a moment to assess the situation calmly. Ask yourself whether this issue truly warrants your involvement or if it can be resolved more efficiently through another method. In some cases, it might be beneficial to allow the parties involved to handle the issue themselves, as intervening could result in increased conflict or the loss of organizational learning opportunities. 2. Talk to Colleagues When faced with a workplace challenge, don't hesitate to seek the guidance of your colleagues or supervisors. They can provide valuable perspective and advice based on their experience and understanding of the problem. Discussing the issue with multiple colleagues increases the likelihood of identifying potential blind spots in your thought process and ensures that you fully understand the challenge's scope and implications. Remember that collaboration is the foundation of a successful working environment and can yield innovative solutions. 3. Keep a Record Maintaining detailed records of workplace challenges is vital for organized problem-solving and to avoid recurring issues. Document all relevant details, including dates, involved parties, discussions, and actions taken, to create a complete picture of the situation. This information can be reviewed and analyzed in the event of future disputes, misunderstandings, or similar challenges. A thorough record helps to identify patterns, reinforces accountability, and provides evidence when support or clarification is required. 4. Consider Your Options Once you have a clear understanding of the workplace challenge, it's time to consider the potential solutions. Approach this step with an open mind, creativity, and objectivity, as there might be multiple viable options you have not initially considered. Generate a list of possible solutions, carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each, and consult with your colleagues or supervisors to ensure you have considered all possible angles. It's crucial to remember that your final decision should align with your company's values and priorities, and aim to achieve a fair and positive outcome for all involved parties. Conclusion Workplace challenges can be daunting, but approaching them with a structured and empathetic mindset yields the best results. Take the time to decide if action is required, seek input from colleagues, maintain thorough records, and weigh your options carefully. By following these strategies, you can effectively manage and resolve workplace challenges, foster a supportive and collaborative working environment, and enhance your problem-solving skills."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Veteran K-9 officer Daniel Peabody has been accused of killing three of his dogs, two of which were K-9 police dogs. (CBS46)      Daniel Peabody loved his dogs.      At least, that’s the way it looked to students whenever Peabody, a hulking and heavily tattooed school cop, strode into northern Georgia classrooms with a K-9 at his side.      The lieutenant loved his animal partners so much that when one dog retired, Peabody promptly adopted him.      But Peabody wasn’t the dog savior he portrayed himself to be, authorities say.      Instead, the veteran K-9 officer now stands accused of leaving one police dog in a roasting car to die and executing another.      Cherokee Co Schools Police Lt Daniel Peabody could face animal cruelty charges. His K9 Inka died in his hot car. pic.twitter.com/OGqDGohNMz — Matt Johnson (@MJohnsonWSB) June 11, 2016      On Tuesday, investigators announced that the remains of a third dog — unearthed in Peabody’s back yard — indicated the animal also had been shot, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.      The alleged case of animal cruelty is all the more bizarre because of the special protections police departments bestow on the expensive and highly trained animals.      [‘No choice but to start stabbing’: Family fights off retired K-9 as he mauls man who gave him water]      In Georgia, for instance, it is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to intentionally kill a K9 — a penalty stiffened just last year after a police dog was killed in the line of duty.      Few in Cherokee County could have imagined that the biggest threat to a beloved police dog was the man holding its leash.      Daniel Peabody. (Cherokee County Marshal’s Office)      The strange story dates to at least 2012, but only came to light last month.      On June 10, Peabody and his pawed partner, Inca, a four-year-old Belgian Malinois, came home from work about 4:15 p.m.      Peabody, a 16-year police veteran who had worked with K-9s for five years, rushed inside to deal with another dog, Cherokee County Marshal’s Office Maj. Jamie Gianfala told the Marietta Daily Journal.      Nearly three hours later, Peabody suddenly remembered he had left Inca in his squad car. When Peabody went outside to check on the dog, she was dead, Gianfala said.      Gianfala also said Peabody’s 2001 Ford Crown Victoria was not equipped for police dogs.      “There’s no kennel, there’s no alarms,” he added. “It’s basically just a Crown Vic police car.”      Gorgeous K9 gone too soon. Inka died when she was left in a hot car. Ch. 2 right now. https://t.co/o07Uq0QIdn pic.twitter.com/7exiUb9KAs — Matt Johnson (@MJohnsonWSB) June 12, 2016      The temperature that afternoon was in the 90s, “and that was outside, so I’m sure the temperature in that police car was much higher,” added Chief Marshal Ron Hunton.      Hunton told the Daily Journal that Peabody was visibly distraught over the dog’s death, hyperventilating so badly that he had to be taken to a hospital and passed out at one point.      “He is very, very upset about the death of his dog,” Hunton said.      A few days later, Peabody abruptly resigned, according to the Journal-Constitution.      When authorities investigated Inca’s death, however, they quickly stumbled upon other suspicious incidents involving the K-9 officer and his partners.      When they asked Peabody about Dale, a yellow lab he adopted in 2012 after five years of working alongside the animal, Peabody initially said the retired dog died in a freak accident.      Dale, retired k9 living w/former school police Lt. Daniel Peabody. Police say Peabody killed him too. Live at 4 pic.twitter.com/uVkLRwEuXO — Tyisha Fernandes (@TyishaWSB) June 22, 2016      “Peabody initially claimed Dale’s death was accidental due to Dale choking on a toy,” the marshal’s office said in a statement, according to the Journal-Constitution. “However, the investigation yielded evidence that Dale was in fact shot and killed by Peabody at his Paulding County home.”      On June 20, investigators executing a search warrant on Peabody’s former home in Paulding County unearthed the remains of a dog they suspected was Dale.      Peabody was charged with aggravated cruelty to animals and making a false statement to investigators.      His wife, Tyler Verlander, meanwhile, was cited for operating a dog boarding and training business without a Cherokee County occupation tax certificate, according to the Journal-Constitution. She was also charged with operating a boarding and training business inside a residential district and too close to a residential property. The charges are unrelated to the K-9 deaths.      On Tuesday, investigators announced yet another twist in the curious case.      A forensic veterinarian had determined that the dog remains did not, in fact, belong to Dale.      Instead, they belonged to a Belgian Malinois — possibly Inca’s grandmother.      The discovery brought to three the number of dogs Peabody is suspected of killing, although authorities say the development won’t affect charges facing the former school cop.      Dale’s body remains unaccounted for. ||||| Just One More Thing...      We have sent you a verification email. Please check your email and click on the link to activate your profile.

Investigators have found the remains of a third dog at the former Paulding County home of Daniel Peabody, who was arrested after his police K-9 officer, Inca, was found dead of heat stroke after being left inside his patrol car.      Back in June, police said Peabody arrived to his home in Cherokee County and turned his patrol car off, leaving the 4-year-old dog in the back of the car. Peabody then went inside his home to deal with another dog.      Peabody told police that he remembered that he left the dog in his patrol car a few hours later and when he went outside to check, he found that Inca was dead.      Peabody also allegedly admitted to shooting another former K-9 partner, a yellow lab named Dale. When Dale died, Peabody reported he choked on a toy. After his arrest he changed his story and said he shot the police dog.      When Cherokee County investigators began looking for Dale's remains, it lead them to Peabody's former home in Dallas where his ex-wife still lives.      Cherokee County and Paulding County authorities worked together digging at the property and found the remains of a dog. The dog was not Dale. Police report this third dog is a Belgian Malinois and Inca's grandmother. It was not a police dog but believed to be Peabody's former pet. It was shot in the head.      \\"The vets examined the remains and found that they were not Dale, but were those of a Belgian Malinois,\\" said Ron Huston, Chief Marshall with the Cherokee County Marshall's Office.      Cherokee County Marshal's said Peabody has retained a lawyer and is no longer talking. They cannot ask him about the dead dog found in his yard or the circumstances surrounding its death.      Peabody is out on bond. CBS46 went to his former home to ask about the third dog but were asked to leave the property.      Copyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

There’s something special about going to the movies: As viewers become immersed in the film, their faces relax, and their eyes widen a bit, in a moment of un-self-conscious wonder. Movies give us a capacity for awe. Good film projectionists know this, and present their audience with the best moviegoing experience possible, with a personalized touch no technology can truly replicate. But with the impending end of 35-millimeter projection, the craft is fading away. In recent years, movie theaters around the world have gone digital, and for some of us die-hard movie lovers, this transition has been really painful. We believe that a weathered film print is like a beloved vinyl record. It’s not that the pops and scratches on an old record sound good — but there’s a romance in knowing that a film print has screened for others. A digital copy of a movie carries no history. It’s clean and new every time. It has no memory, and it has no soul. So maybe that’s what this pain is about — a cry against so many things in our lives that are going digital. It’s a cry of longing for things to be tactile and organic. Part of the heartbreak of this digital transition is feeling the loss of yet another handcrafted profession — of a job that took skill and precision and ingenuity. This Op-Doc video focuses on the experience of the Little Art Theatre, a beloved theater near my home in Ohio, which transitioned to digital in 2013. The theater staff can now start the movie from the lobby, by pushing a few buttons.The head projectionist has a lot less to do. The digital era is clearly here to stay, and the transition makes sense for any number of reasons (the films no longer break in the middle, digital is better for the environment and quality is consistent, to name a few). But this short documentary is my elegy to the fading days of celluloid. Steven Bognar is an independent filmmaker in Dayton, Ohio, and a former projectionist at Theater 80 St. Marks in New York City. His documentary with Julia Reichert, “The Last Truck: Closing of a G.M. Plant,” was nominated for an Academy Award. Their film “A Lion in the House” won an Emmy Award.

The butter provided a rich and creamy depth of flavor to the turkey, infusing it with moisture and helping the meat remain tender and juicy during the cooking process. Additionally, the butter also acted as a medium for the spices and seasoning to adhere to, ensuring an even distribution of flavor throughout the turkey. On the other hand, the pineapple gave it a sweeter taste, bringing a pleasant element of brightness to the dish. Moreover, as a tropical fruit, pineapple carries a natural acidity that helped to tenderize the turkey, ensuring the meat was succulent and easy to cut. This acidity also complemented the richness of the butter, creating a well-balanced flavor profile that delighted the tastebuds. Furthermore, the pineapple imparted a fruity and tangy flavor to the dish, harmonizing beautifully with the savory spices and herbs used in the preparation of the turkey. Incorporating pineapple into the recipe introduced an element of culinary creativity and innovation, resulting in a unique and appetizing spin on a traditional turkey dish. In addition, cooking with pineapple also offers some health benefits, as it contains a wealth of essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, vitamin A, and potassium. It is also rich in the enzyme bromelain, which is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to aid digestion. In conclusion, the turkey coated with butter and pineapple to finish it off showcases a marriage of flavors, resulting in a rich and succulent dish with both savory and sweet elements. The butter ensures moisture and creaminess, while the pineapple adds a delightful sweetness and acidity, creating a harmonious and delicious taste experience. This unique combination of ingredients elevates a traditional turkey dish and offers a new and innovative way to enjoy a classic favorite."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Process:  - Some of the rock in the ground is made of limestone - Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone - And cause a acidic reaction - The limestone will slowly disintegrate - A large gap with be where the limestone was - Result in the cave.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose limestone is removed from the ground due to mining happens, how will it affect over long periods of time rain hits more limestone.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the perturbation caused by removing limestone from the ground due to mining activities can have a direct effect on the natural cave-forming process. The process, also known as karstification, generally involves the dissolution of limestone by rainwater or other acidic water sources over long periods of time. When this occurs naturally, large gaps or voids are created where the limestone has dissolved, ultimately leading to the formation of caves. When limestone is removed from the ground due to mining, it alters the natural landscape by creating voids and gaps similar to those formed during the cave-forming process. However, these gaps and voids caused by mining are generally not as stable or secure as those formed through the natural dissolution of limestone. As a result, the following consequences may arise: 1. Increased risk of subsidence: With the removal of limestone, the ground above the area may become unstable, especially when rainwater starts to infiltrate and affect more limestone. Over time, this can lead to the ground collapsing and creating sinkholes, posing safety risks to the surrounding area and infrastructure. 2. Change in water drainage patterns: Limestone layers often serve as important aquifers, helping to store and transmit groundwater. With the removal of limestone, the natural drainage patterns of groundwater can be disrupted, which may alter the flow and distribution of water in the region. 3. Altered cave formation process: The removal of limestone due to mining can undoubtedly affect the natural cave-forming process. Caves may not form in their typical locations or may form at a slower rate due to the altered availability of limestone for dissolution. Furthermore, the mining-induced voids may lead to the development of caves in unstable and unnatural environments. 4. Destruction of existing caves and ecosystems: Mining may damage or destroy existing caves and their fragile ecosystems, which can endanger local plant and animal species that have adapted specifically to life within these subterranean habitats. In summary, the removal of limestone due to mining may indeed have a direct effect on the cave-forming process by altering the availability of limestone for dissolution, increasing the risk of subsidence, disrupting natural water drainage patterns, and potentially damaging existing caves and ecosystems."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If the freezer is not functioning correctly, it may not reach the freezing point of water (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius). As a result, the water in the ice cube tray would not freeze as expected, or it may take significantly longer to freeze. The temperature of the freezer is a direct factor affecting the freezing process, so in this case, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process, causing the water to freeze more slowly or not at all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write highlights for this article: There's no arguing that Apple set the standard for modern mobile devices with the iPhone and the iPad. It didn't take long after those two products launched for competitors to rush out their own copycat devices. Even then, it took another few years before Android was good enough to go toe to toe with iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. But it's no longer about being just as good as Apple. You have to be better. Competitors have built upon the foundation Apple laid in mobile and are now leapfrogging it with bunch of useful features you can't find on iPhones and iPads. The evidence is everywhere, but it's most apparent in products made by Apple's biggest mobile rival, Samsung. By now, Samsung's Galaxy devices have become synonymous with Android, to the point that the manufacturer has more brand recognition than any other phone or tablet running Google's operating system. A lot of that has to do with Samsung's massive marketing budget, but you can't ignore the fact that the company has innovated a lot by creating popular new product categories that Apple is wary to try. The best example of this is the Galaxy Note, a smartphone-tablet hybrid with a giant screen. When that device first hit the United States about a year ago, critics (including me) slammed the device for being too large. It couldn't fit comfortably in your pocket. It was really thick. And it came with a stylus, that relic of the Palm Pilot era, making the Note feel like a step backward. None of that mattered. Samsung sold at least 10 million Galaxy Notes. The company came out with an updated version with an even larger screen called the Galaxy Note II a few months later and sold another 5 million (at last count), a very big achievement for a single Android device. But more importantly, Samsung created a new category of smartphone that people didn't even know they wanted, much like Apple did when it released the first iPhone. Samsung isn't afraid to tout its cool factor either. Since the first commercial debuted in late 2011, you've probably seen those \\"Next Big Thing\\" ads that make fun of starry-eyed Apple fans waiting in line for the next iPhone. Whether it's boasting about the bigger screens or sharing content by tapping phones together, Samsung seems content to blast Apple for its stuffiness while showing in a practical context what its devices can do. On the software side of things, Samsung is taking advantage of its mobile devices' processing power to layer premium features on top of Android, such as the ability to run two apps at once in a split screen or separate window. Samsung's best tablet, the Galaxy Note 10.1, can do all that plus take advantage of a stylus so you can draw and take notes on the screen. There is a downside to the split-screen thing, however. Developers have to tweak their apps to work in split-screen mode on the Note 10.1. There are only about 20 apps right now that can do it. But what's most important is how nimble Samsung has become at improving its mobile devices through software updates. The Note 10.1 launched last fall, but it received a software update with a new version of Android and a slew of other features like the voice assistant Google Now, which is a lot more impressive than Apple's original Siri. Samsung's director of product planning, Shoneel Kolhatkar, said the company takes user and reviewer feedback into account when preparing to deliver new software updates. Instead of making users wait a year for new features, Kolhatkar said Samsung can use that feedback to deliver \\"incremental innovation that keeps the product alive.\\" \\"We want to keep the product relevant to consumers,\\" Kolhatkar said. \\"It's about how to fit our devices into people's lives versus changing their behavior.\\" Samsung isn't alone, of course. Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system is built for touchscreen devices like tablets, too, and it offers a lot of advantages over iOS. All Windows 8 apps can run in a split screen so you can run two at once, plus the main menu is capable of displaying real-time updates for stuff like news and weather. Microsoft even has its own line of Surface tablets that blur the line between PC and laptop thanks to a clever snap-on keyboard cover. Based on all this evidence, Apple feels behind. Take a look at its newest fourth-generation iPad. It has a killer processor and other great hardware features, but the operating system doesn't take advantage of any of that. The home screen is still just a grid of static icons that launch apps. Apple also isn't nearly as versatile at adding new software features to its devices. Apple usually makes users wait a year or more for a new version of iOS, and even then some older devices can't access all the latest and greatest features. Apple CEO Tim Cook likes to say tablets -- not laptops -- are the future of computing, yet it feels like Apple's software goes out of its way to limit what you can do on the machine. Meanwhile there are others, especially Samsung, that appear to be innovating at a pace faster than Apple can. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Kovach.","output":"Apple's mobile devices such as the iPhone and iPad have undoubtedly set the standard for modern mobile technology. However, competitors are now building upon Apple's foundation and offering a range of features not present in Apple products. This is particularly obvious with Samsung's Galaxy devices, which have become synonymous with Android. Part of Samsung's success is due to their willingness to innovate and create popular new product categories - the Galaxy Note, a smartphone-tablet hybrid with an oversized screen, is a prime example. Samsung is also not shy to promote its features in comparison to Apple's mobile devices, with advertisements pointing out larger screens, easy content-sharing functions and more. Moreover, Samsung is using its mobile devices' processing power to provide premium features in addition to Android, such as the ability to run two apps simultaneously in a split-screen or separate window. In contrast, Apple's more recent devices, such as the fourth-generation iPad, seem limited in their innovation and versatility, and updates to the iOS operating system are less frequent. With competitors such as Samsung investing in rapid innovation and products tailored to consumers' lives, it is suggested that Apple has now fallen behind in the race for mobile tech innovation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1944, masterpieces of modern art stolen by the Wehrmacht are being shipped to Germany; the officer in charge of the operation, Colonel Franz von Waldheim (Paul Scofield), is determined to take the paintings to Germany, no matter the cost. After the works chosen by Waldheim are removed from the Jeu de Paume Museum, curator Mademoiselle Villard (Suzanne Flon) seeks help from the French Resistance. Given the imminent liberation of Paris by the Allies, they need only delay the train for a few days, but it is a dangerous operation and must be done in a way that does not risk damaging the priceless cargo. Although Resistance cell leader and SNCF area inspector Paul Labiche (Burt Lancaster) initially rejects the plan, telling Mlle. Villard and senior Resistance leader Spinet (Paul Bonifas), \\"I won't waste lives on paintings,\\" he has a change of heart after a cantankerous elderly engineer, Papa Boule (Michel Simon), is executed for trying to sabotage the train on his own. After that sacrifice, Labiche joins his Resistance teammates Didont (Albert RÃ©my) and Pesquet (Charles Millot), who have been organizing their own plan to stop the train with the help of other SNCF Resistance members. They devise an elaborate ruse to reroute the train, temporarily changing railway station signage to make it appear to the German escort as if they are heading to Germany when they have actually turned back toward Paris. They then arrange a double collision in the small town of Rive-Reine that will block the train without risking the cargo. Labiche, although shot in the leg, escapes on foot with the help of the widowed owner of a Rive-Reine hotel, Christine (Jeanne Moreau), while other Resistance members involved in the plot are executed. The night after the collision, Labiche and Didont meet Spinet again, along with young Robert (the nephew of Jacques, the executed Rive-Reine station master) and plan to paint the tops of three boxcars white to warn off Allied aircraft from bombing the art train.

Q: Context: The Wada test is a diagnostic method to anesthetize 1 cerebral hemisphere and assess the language and memory functions of awake contralateral hemisphere before temporal lobectomy in patients with epilepsy. The effects of an ipsilateral injection of etomidate on the functional properties of contralateral hemisphere are not known. Our aim was to characterize the electroencephalographic (EEG) effects after intracarotid injection of etomidate and to determine the changes in synchronization between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres.', 'We retrospectively analyzed EEG data from 15 patients who underwent Wada test with etomidate. Continuous EEG data from 4 electrodes (2 anterior [F3, F4] and 2 posterior [P3, P4]) were analyzed. After artifact rejection, we measured the amplitudes of delta (1 to 4 Hz) and alpha (7 to 13 Hz) waves and the changes in the interhemispheric synchronization before, during, and after etomidate injection.', 'Ipsilateral injection of etomidate causes EEG changes in both hemispheres with increased amplitude of delta waves anteriorly and the alpha waves posteriorly. However this effect of etomidate is not uniform. Although there was a decrease in the interhemispheric synchronization of delta waves, there was no change in the synchronization of the alpha waves. Answer: Our study showed that the EEG effects of intracarotid ipsilateral injection of etomidate is not uniform in both hemispheres.

Danny owned two parcels of land. parcel A had a soil with high salinity levels, while parcel B had a rich and healthy soil.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which parcel had more plants which presented a disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell?","output":"Based on the information given, parcel A had soil with high salinity levels. High salinity levels in soil typically cause an increase in the concentration of sodium ions (Na+) outside the plant cells. This can cause a disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of plant cells. In normal conditions, the Na+/K+ ratio is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump, which actively transports sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell and potassium ions (K+) into the cell. This is crucial for various cellular functions, including maintaining cell membrane potential, protein synthesis, and overall cell growth. When a plant experiences high salinity levels, the excess sodium ions in the soil can cause difficulties for the sodium-potassium pump to maintain the ideal Na+/K+ ratio. The higher concentration of sodium ions can lead to an influx of Na+ into the plant cells, thereby disrupting the Na+/K+ balance. This condition can negatively impact the plant's overall physiological processes, leading to impaired growth, reduced yield, and in extreme cases, plant death. Hence, parcel A, with its high salinity levels, would have more plants presenting a disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cells compared to parcel B, which had rich and healthy soil."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",B,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
