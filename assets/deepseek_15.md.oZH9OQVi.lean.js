Options: - movies - idaho - university - cafe - universe  The answer is \\"cafe\\" because The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"cafe\\" because a cafe is an establishment that caters specifically to providing coffee, sandwiches, and other beverages and light meals to its patrons in a comfortable atmosphere. The other options mentioned do not exclusively serve as places where people can enjoy a cup of coffee and a sandwich, as they have different primary functions. Here is a detailed analysis of the other options: 1. Movies: Although movies, or more accurately, movie theaters, do offer a range of refreshments and snacks, their primary purpose is to showcase films for people to watch. The choice of food and beverages available in movie theaters is usually limited, and they may not always offer coffee or sandwiches. Furthermore, a movie theater is designed for communal viewing experiences, and the main focus will always be on the film being shown, rather than on facilitating a relaxed environment for enjoying a cup of coffee and a sandwich. 2. Idaho: Idaho is a state in the United States that contains a variety of food establishments, including cafes, restaurants, and bars. However, Idaho is a geographical area and not a specific place where one can have a cup of coffee or a sandwich. It does not directly compare to a cafe, which is a designated food and beverage establishment. 3. University: A university is an institution of higher education and research focused on teaching, learning, and research. Although universities may have cafes, restaurants, or food courts on their campus, the primary purpose of a university is not to provide a space for people to have coffee or sandwiches; it exists to provide education and facilitate research. The presence of cafes or food establishments at a university is to cater to the needs of students, faculty, and staff, as well as visitors, but they are not the main focus of the institution. 4. Universe: The universe refers to the totality of space, matter, time, energy, and various phenomena that have been observed and analyzed by scientists and astronomers. Including everything that exists from galaxies to subatomic particles, the universe is not a suitable place for humans to have a cup of coffee or a sandwich, as it does not refer to a specific location or establishment designed to offer these items. In conclusion, out of the options provided, a cafe stands out as the most appropriate answer because it specifically caters to offering coffee, sandwiches, and other food and beverages in a comfortable environment. While some of the other options may have food establishments within them, their primary focus is not to provide people with a place to have a cup of coffee or a sandwich. Therefore, the most suitable answer is \\"cafe.\\""},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given a context, a question, three options, and an answer.

Families SA considered the parenting skills of Chloe Valentine's drug-using teenage mother to be 'good enough' despite evidence of neglect, an inquest has heard. Chloe was four years old when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 after being forced to ride a motorbike and repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in her Adelaide backyard. An inquest into the girl's death has heard her short life was marred by horrific squalor and chronic neglect but she was never removed from her mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne. Scroll down for video. Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012. Social worker Leanne Stewart told the inquest on Wednesday she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17. Chloe's teenage mother allowed the 18-month-old to be supervised by other teenagers for extended periods, despite being warned by Ms Stewart that this was not acceptable. Family members, including Polkinghorne's father, raised alarms about infant Chloe's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother. But Ms Stewart believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was 'frequent conflict' in Polkinghorne's family relationships. An inquest into Chloe's death heard that social workers knew that her mother, drug user Ashley Polkinghorne, was neglecting her daughter from 18-months-old. Chloe died at the hands of her parents after she was repeatedly forced to crash a  motorbike over a three-day period. Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' and found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her often rubbish-strewn house, Ms Stewart said. Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, questioned why Ms Stewart was excusing Polkinghorne's behaviour, saying her obligation was to protect infant Chloe. 'She was a teenager with a baby,' Ms Kereru said. Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months. Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012. 'You're there to protect the baby, not make excuses for the mother, aren't you?' 'That's what you just did.' Ms Stewart denied that she was reluctant to act on the child abuse allegations, saying it took time for parents such as Polkinghorne to make sustained changes. Polkinghorne, now 22, and a later partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, were jailed this year over Chloe's death after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect. The inquest continues. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article talks about a sad story of a little girl named Chloe Valentine. She was four years old when she got hurt very badly and passed away in 2012. Her mommy, Ashlee Polkinghorne, didn't take good care of her and let bad things happen to her. Some people who were supposed to help children like Chloe didn't do their job very well, and they let Chloe stay with her mommy even though she was not a good mommy. There is a meeting happening now, called an inquest, to find out why those people didn't do a better job to protect Chloe. Both Chloe's mommy and her mommy's friend, Benjamin McPartland, went to jail because they didn't take care of Chloe the way they should have."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From Easy Street (1917) to Modern Times (1936), he made many of the funniest and most popular films of his time. He is best known for his character \\"the little tramp  \\". It is this kind-hearted character that we connect with the time of silent movies.      Born in London in 1889, Chaplin first visited America with a theater company in 1907. Appearing as Billy in the play Sherlock Holmes, the young Chaplin toured the country twice. On his second tour, he met Mack Sennett and was signed to Keystone Studios to act in films. In 1914, Chaplin made his first short film, Making a Living. That same year, he made thirty-four more short films. These early silent shorts allowed very little time for anything but physical comedy, and Chaplin was extremely good at it.     Chaplin was known as one of the most demanding men in Hollywood. No matter how big or tiny the size of the part, Chaplin walked each actor through every scene. Chaplin knew that a successful scene wasn't simply about the star, but about everyone on the screen. He required that all the actors and actresses work together in every performance. The only way to achieve it was to keep complete control over every scene. As he became more popular, he used more and more creative and difficult filming techniques. Movies such as his 1925 hit, The Gold Rush, required endless reworking of scenes and rebuilding of sets.      Though Chaplin is of the silent movie era, his achievements were carried over into the films of today. His strictness and concern for the processes of acting and directing made his films great and led the way to a new and more wonderful cinema. Chaplin's working life in entertainment lasted over 75 years, from the Victorian stage and the music hall in the United Kingdom as a child performer, until close to his death at the age of 88. A:","output":"Which statement about Charlie Chaplin is true according to the article? A. Chaplin was born in London and first visited America in 1925. B. His character \\"the little tramp\\" was not popular among silent movie fans. C. Chaplin was known to be demanding towards actors and was focused on perfecting each scene. D. He had a short career in entertainment, lasting only 30 years. Answer: C. Chaplin was known to be demanding towards actors and was focused on perfecting each scene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.  However, Dortmunder cannot access the box because of bank vault security, and the gang leaves Abe in Dr. Amusa's office while they come up with a plan.

Please answer the following question: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients? Options: - Their blood pressure treatment protocol will stay the same.   - not enough information   - They will be enrolled in a study.   - They will call their doctor. === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"Their blood pressure treatment protocol will stay the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Act 1: The movie opens with Gotham City celebrating the new high-tech Bat-Signal's unveiling ceremony. During this event, the city officials and the police force are gathered to pay tribute to Batman for his heroic fight against crime that has slowly turned the city around. As District Attorney, Harvey Dent attends the ceremony as the city's most outspoken advocate for justice. While at the event, he stumbles upon a mysterious note hidden inside the Bat-Signal's control box. The cryptic message reads, \\"The blind eye of justice hides in the darkness of Gotham's soul.\\" Intrigued by the enigmatic nature of the note, Harvey Dent becomes adamant about discovering the identity of its author and the message's true meaning. He enlists the help of his ally, Jim Gordon, and together they begin an investigation. Act 2: Gordon and Dent uncover that the note's author has intimate knowledge of Gotham's most notorious criminals. The message serves as a code that leads them to a secret network of organized crime that has been orchestrating chaos for years, hidden from public view. As the duo delves deeper, physical evidence and hidden messages from the mysterious author lead them to dangerous encounters with mob bosses, corrupt officials, and masked criminals, taking the pair on a treacherous path through the darkest corners of Gotham. Throughout their investigation, Harvey Dent starts to struggle with his own moral compass. His concept of black-and-white justice begins to blur as he finds himself in questionable situations and making difficult decisions, all in the name of fighting evil. As the story progresses, Harvey's duality intensifies, reflecting the same complexities present in his hometown. Act 3: In the thrilling climax, Dent and Gordon uncover a secret society of powerful individuals running Gotham's criminal underworld and the political scene, with the mysterious author at its helm. Confronting this twisted villain, the author reveals he has been testing Harvey Dent's moral integrity all along, wanting to expose the flaws in Gotham's justice system. Feeling betrayed by the city he vowed to protect, Harvey's internal conflict reaches its peak. As his dual personalities collide, Two-Face emerges, symbolizing the unresolvable duality of Gotham and its broken justice system. In the end, Batman steps in to help Gordon stop Harvey Dent, who has now become Two-Face. Batman painfully apprehends his former ally, who has fallen to the dark side of corruption, while simultaneously dismantling the secret society behind Gotham's chaos. Through the dark journey into Gotham's soul, our protagonists learn that the struggle between good and evil is never-ending. The movie concludes with Batman's promise to always work tirelessly to protect the city, even if the corruption he fights may very well consume those he trusts the most."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plants also detect the daily cycle of light and darkness. Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off.

With this in mind, Mayor Ron Norick pushed through a massive plan for capital improvements throughout downtown called the Metropolitan Area Projects Plan, or MAPS. MAPS called for a five-year, one-cent sales tax to fund a new ballpark, a canal through Bricktown, a new central library, a large indoor arena, renovations to the fairgrounds and the civic center, and a series of low water dams on the North Canadian River to make it attractive and accessible to small boats.

Choices: 1. yes. 2. no.","output":"2. no. The statement provided, \\"She agreed to visit the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington and take a drive through London in an open carriage,\\" does not answer the question about the year that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle. Instead, it refers to a separate event involving Queen Victoria taking a drive and visiting gardens in London. To answer the question, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle, located in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in the year 1852. Balmoral Castle is a private residence of the British royal family and serves as a holiday retreat where they spend time during the summer months. The Queen and her husband, Prince Albert, discovered the castle and the surrounding area in 1848 and quickly fell in love with the location. They decided to purchase the Balmoral estate, which at the time was a relatively small and humble hunting lodge. Within a few years, from 1853 to 1856, they commissioned the construction of a new, larger castle in the Scottish Baronial architecture style, designed by architect William Smith. Since then, Balmoral Castle has served as a personal and private residence for the British royal family, providing an escape from the formal obligations of the London life. Many royals find solace, peace, and tranquility in the beautiful Scottish Highlands surrounding the castle. Over the years, Balmoral has been expanded and improved with added facilities such as cottages, lodges, and even a private church. To recap, the year in which Queen Victoria and Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle was 1852, and the statement provided about visiting the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society and taking a carriage ride in London does not answer the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  and a hint : Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.  Please answer this question : Would car A emit less or more carbon monoxide than car B? Answer:","output":"Car A would emit less carbon monoxide than car B.  Step 1: Identify the presence of a catalytic converter in each car. Car A: Has a catalytic converter. Car B: Does not have a catalytic converter.

These behaviors usually occur as the result of Choose your answer from: [a]. competition; [b]. conservation; [c]. decomposition; [d]. pollution; Your answer:","output":"[a]. competition; Animals may fight, make threatening sounds, and act aggressively toward members of the same species as a result of competition. There are various factors that may lead to competitive behaviors among animals. These factors include, but are not limited to, competition for resources, mating opportunities, and territory. Understanding the reasons for these behaviors can give insight into the lives of animals and their social dynamics. 1. Competition for resources: The most fundamental reason for aggressive behaviors among animals is competition for limited resources, such as food, water, and shelter. As resources in the environment are finite, animals of the same species often find themselves competing for the same necessities in order to meet their needs and ensure survival. This competition can lead to physical confrontations, posturing, and vocal displays meant to establish dominance and deter rivals. 2. Mating opportunities: Animals may also display aggressive behaviors to gain access to potential mates. Mating is crucial for the survival of a species, as it ensures the continuation of genetic traits and the possibility for offspring. Individuals that are successful in securing mates and producing offspring thus have higher chances of contributing their genes to the following generation. This can result in sexual selection, where certain traits, behaviors, and displays become more common because those individuals possessing them are more likely to reproduce. Male animals, in particular, may engage in displays, ritualized combat, or physical contests to secure a female and reproduce. 3. Territorial defense: Territory plays a significant role in the survival and reproductive success of many animal species. By establishing and defending territories, animals can secure exclusive access to resources, mates, and ideal nesting or denning sites. Animals may use aggressive behaviors to defend their territories from rivals, displaying aggression through vocalizations, posture, marking, and other signs. In some cases, confrontations may escalate to physical altercations, often with the intent to drive the rival away or establish dominance. Generally, the advantages of having a territory outweigh the risks and costs of these aggressive behaviors. Aggressive behaviors and conflict are natural aspects of animal life, driven by the need to secure resources, mates, and territory. Competition and aggression have significant impacts on the social structures and overall dynamics of many animal species, shaping their evolutionary history and influencing their behaviors. While these behaviors may seem harsh or violent, they ultimately serve to ensure the survival and successful reproduction of the individuals involved, thereby supporting the continuation of their species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Every time your dog is able to go to the bathroom in his designated spot, reward him with a little treat, lots of praise, and a scratch on the head. You can, of course, reward your dog for other things, like learning how to sit and stay. All good behavior should be rewarded. When you're treating your dog for going to the bathroom in his spot, give him a treat and praise right after he finishes relieving himself. Don't give it too early or too late, or he won't associate it with going to the bathroom in the right spot. Some people have had success using the bell method instead of a treat. When your dog goes to the bathroom in his spot, you ring a bell or pleasant-sounding chime as part of his reward. The dog will come to look forward to the sound of the chime, which should only be used in this specific situation. The drawback here is that, eventually, you won't want to keep using a chime or bell every time your dog goes to the bathroom. Initially phasing it out might be confusing to the dog. Whenever you're taking your dog to the bathroom or talking about it, keep your voice light and pleasant. Never raise your voice or take on a menacing tone, because your dog will start to associate his bodily functions with punishment and fear. If your dog makes a mess inside, you can withhold praise, but don't yell at the dog or make him feel ashamed. If using verbal cues, such as \\"outside\\", \\"go potty\\", or \\"good dog\\" be consistent. The repetition of these words along with the action and environment will reinforce where you want your dog to relieve himself. Dogs don't respond well to punishment. It scares them and instead of learning to perform well for you, they learn to fear you. Never yell, hit, or do anything that could cause your dog to feel afraid. Do not rub your dog's face in his mess. Contrary to some beliefs, this does not teach a dog not to go to the bathroom in the house. The dog will not understand what you're doing and you'll just end up scaring him. Summary:","output":"The article emphasizes that dogs learn best through positive reinforcement, and it is essential to reward good behavior, such as going to the bathroom in the designated spot or learning new commands. It is important to give the reward and praise immediately after the dog completes the desired action so that the dog can make the proper association. Some people use the bell method as a form of reward, but phasing it out can be confusing for the dog. When training your dog, use a light and pleasant voice and never raise it or use a menacing tone, as this can lead to associating bodily functions with punishment and fear. If the dog makes a mess indoors, withhold praise but do not yell or make the dog feel ashamed. Consistency in verbal cues and repetition helps reinforce desired behavior. Punishment is not effective in dog training and can lead to fear. Avoid any actions that may scare or harm the dog, such as rubbing its face in a mess, as it does not help in teaching the dog where to relieve itself and can end up scaring the dog. Instead, focus on positivity and reinforcement to encourage good behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Which 2016 Presidential Potential Had the Best 2014? The 2014 election isn’t over yet, but 2016 loomed over the campaign trail as presidential potentials made their way across the country in the role of surrogates. So who played that role the best in the last few months? Michael Steele, the former Chairman of the Republican National Committee told Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that in terms of 2014, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (R) has had the best year. “He’s got the organization on the ground right now. He’s in all 50 states. He’s got young folks gravitating towards him. He’s got African-Americans taking a pause and looking at him.” NBC Political Analyst Joe Scarborough agreed that Paul is talented and that he’s going to run a better campaign than his father but, “He’s not going to win because Main Street Republicans win and you’ve got two choices that we talked about here, Jeb or Chris Christie.” And he had a different take on who has had the best 2014. “Without a doubt, Mitt Romney, Mitt was right on Russia. Mitt was right on Iraq,” said the MSNBC host. As for the Democratic side, the panel agreed that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has some more work to do. “I don’t know how you lose a book tour. That’s a hard thing to lose, but she’s got plenty of time to regroup,” said NBC’s Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell. Former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs concurred. \\"I don't think she's had a particularly good run with the book. I wouldn't have done as many interviews as she did.

Fold the top edge down to the center so that the edge rests along the line from the previous fold. Do the same with the bottom edge so that both edges of the paper meet in the center. Then open the sheet of paper again. The paper should now have one line going diagonally across and three horizontal lines dividing the paper into quarters. Fold them to the line from the last step, the horizontal line closest to the top. The corners will make a right triangle when properly folded; the bottom of that triangle should sit on the horizontal line, and the diagonal line from the first step should cut the triangle exactly in half. Repeat the same motion as above: bring the top corner of the paper down to the horizontal line, and fold it so that it forms a triangle whose base sits on that line. However, this time you will have an obtuse rather than a right triangle. The base of this triangle should be the same crease that was the hypotenuse of the right triangle, above. After this step, the overall shape of the paper should be a rectangle half the size of the original square. However, there should be triangular holes from where the corners were folded over. This time, use one of the other corners - if you folded in the top right and bottom left corners in the previous steps, this time use the bottom right corner. Bring the corner to the top center of the rectangle, forming a right triangle as tall as the rectangle. Pick the corner opposite the one you just folded - the only corner that has not yet been folded - and mirror the last step with this corner, bringing it to the bottom center of the rectangle. The fold should form another right triangle adjacent to the one from the previous step. Unfold the two triangles you just folded. Using the bottom right corner again (the one you just unfolded), refold the exact same fold, but this time, rather than folding it on top of the flap of paper from the double-folded corner, slide it underneath. Refold and the top left corner to the center, but this time tuck it under the flap from the double-folded, bottom left corner. Your paper should now be in the shape of a parallelogram, with each corner folded into another so that the whole piece holds together. The back should be smooth (no papers tucked in anywhere) and should have two lines cutting it in half, one horizontal and one diagonal (parallel to the sides). The bottom right should be one of the \\"pointy\\" corners (an acute angle). Fold it to the top right corner, so that the tip meets the angle of the top right corner (an obtuse angle). Essentially, you're folding the vertical side in half, but since it's a parallelogram, not a rectangle, it looks like you're folding in a corner. The bottom of the triangle created by the fold should sit at a right angle to the vertical sides of the parallelogram. Fold the top left hand corner to the bottom center. The paper should now be a perfect square. Unfold the last two folds you made so that the sides stick straight out from the square base, rather than laying flat atop it. Each of these will form one side of the cube, with the two triangles sticking off at right angles serving to connect each side to the rest. You started with six squares of paper, so you should have six folded squares in total. Different color paper was use in this example to clarify the visual instructions. Multiple colors of paper are not required.

Gone are the days of manual labor-intensive tasks, as this versatile piece of equipment can chop, slice, grind, blend, and mix. The possibilities are endless when you start using it. One common question among novice food processor users is how much food and liquid they should use when operating the appliance. In this article, we will cover the basics of using your food processor, including adding the right quantities of both and making some delicious recipes. The Basics: Food and Liquid Measurements When using a food processor for the first time, it is vital to understand the importance of proper measurements. For optimal performance and best results, it is recommended that you place up to 1 cup (236.58 milliliters) of food in the food processor. This ensures that the appliance has enough space for efficient chopping and mixing. Adding liquids to a food processor is another essential aspect of its operation. You should add up to 3 tablespoons (44.36 milliliters) of a liquid, such as water or oil, as needed. Including the appropriate amount of liquid helps the food processor blend and mix ingredients effectively, generating the desired consistency in your recipes. Getting Creative in the Kitchen Now that you know the basics, it's time to experiment and explore the different recipes and ingredients that you can whip up using your food processor. 1. Homemade Pesto Combine fresh basil leaves (about 2 cups), 1 cup of grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup of pine nuts, 1/2 cup of olive oil, and three cloves of garlic in the food processor. Process the ingredients until smooth and well-combined. This homemade pesto is perfect for pasta dishes or as a spread for bruschetta. 2. Fresh Guacamole Place 2 ripe avocados, 1/4 cup of chopped onion, 1/4 cup of chopped tomatoes, 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, 1 minced garlic clove, and the juice of one lime into the food processor. Process until the consistency is slightly chunky, and you have yourself a delicious, fresh bowl of guacamole. 3. Almond Butter Roast 2 cups of almonds in a 180°C (350°F) preheated oven for 10 minutes. Place them in the food processor along with 1-2 tablespoons of neutral oil (such as grapeseed or canola) and process until smooth. Homemade almond butter can be easily customized with honey or maple syrup. 4. Cauliflower Rice Roughly chop 1 head of cauliflower and place it into the food processor. Pulse until the cauliflower reaches a rice-like texture. This low-carb alternative to rice can be cooked like traditional rice or used in recipes like stir-fries, burritos, or sushi. Conclusion Food processors have become an indispensable kitchen tool for both professional chefs and home cooks. Properly measuring your ingredients will help ensure consistent results and avoid overloading the appliance. With a little creativity and understanding of your food processor's capabilities, you can save time and effort in the kitchen, all while preparing tasty and healthier dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3].  Story: Dan harvested lots of fruit and decided to candy some of them to preserve them. He left some fruit fresh for the family to enjoy. He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches. Output:","output":"Question: Why are the candied apples, pears, plums, and quince less likely to spoil compared to the fresh oranges, blueberries, apricots, and peaches?

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Emesinae, or thread-legged bugs, are a subfamily of the Reduviidae (i.e., assassin bugs). They are conspicuously different from the other reduviids by their very slender body form. They are stalking, predatory insects that can be collected on palm fronds, cliffs, spider webbing, or near lights at night (many can be collected by blacklight). They walk on their mid and hind legs; the front pair is raptorial. Some groups specialize on spiders. Very little is known about emesines except that many species are found in the tropics. Pedro Wygodzinsky wrote the most recent revision of this group.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Pseudometapterus is a little - known genus of thread - legged bug in the subfamily Emesinae . Members of the genus occur in North America and usually have wings that are extremely small or absent entirely , though a winged form of P. umbrosus is known from Southern Illinois .  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - The Reduviidae are a large cosmopolitan family of the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are slightly unusual overall, but very common among the Hemiptera because almost all are terrestrial ambush predators (most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic). The main examples of nonpredatory Reduviidae are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae. Though spectacular exceptions are known, most members of the family are fairly easily recognizable; they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build, and formidable curved proboscis (sometimes called a rostrum). Large specimens should be handled with caution, if at all, because they sometimes defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis.  - The tropics are a region of the Earth surrounding the equator. They are delimited in latitude by the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere at  N and the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere at  S; these latitudes correspond to the axial tilt of the Earth. The tropics are also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone (see geographical zone). The tropics include all the areas on the Earth where the Sun is at a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year (which is a subsolar point).  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - The term raptorial implies much the same as \\"predatory\\", but most often refers to modifications of an arthropod's foreleg that make it function for the grasping of prey while it is consumed, where the gripping surfaces are formed from the opposing faces of two successive leg segments (see illustration). This is distinctly different from the grasping mechanism of a structure such as a scorpion's claw (a \\"chela\\") in which one of the opposing surfaces is an articulated digit, and not a leg segment. While this is most widely known in mantises, similarly modified legs can be found in some crustaceans (e.g., mantis shrimp), and various insect families, such as Mantispidae, Belostomatidae, Nepidae, and Naucoridae (all members of these groups have raptorial forelegs). There are numerous other lineages within various insect families that have raptorial forelegs, most commonly seen in the family Reduviidae, but also including several different families of flies, and a few thrips.

Not everyone in the class could take part, but luckily I could. The school chooses a 'twin school'   in a different area of the world. Our head teacher chose a school in Uganda. They gave us someone to write to from that school. For three months, I've written to a girl called Louisa, who is the same age as me. It' s been more interesting to hear about her life. She' s told me all about her school and described her daily   life. I can' t believe that her School doesn' t. have any electricity. She goes to 'school from eight o' clock in the morning until six. O'clock. in the evening. I can' t believe how lucky we are here! She' s also told me that she often can' t go to school because she has to look after her baby brother and sister. She's tried to teach me some of her language and it' s really difficult. I love it because it' s the first time I' ve thought about what life must be like somewhere else. I can' t believe people miss classes here when everything is so easy for us. I think more people should help out with projects like this.

Movie plot title: Without a Trace Movie plot: Susan Selky is a well-known English professor at Columbia University. She lives in a Brooklyn brownstone with her 10-year-old son Alex (Danny Corkill). One March morning, Susan sees Alex off to school, which is only two blocks away. Alex turns to wave to his mother, then disappears around the corner. Susan returns home after work, and becomes increasingly alarmed when Alex is late. She calls her friend and neighbor Jocelyn Norris, whose daughter is a classmate of Alex's, and learns Alex never went to school. She immediately calls the New York City Police Department, and officers descend on the townhouse, led by Lieutenant Al Menetti. Susan is questioned closely on all aspects of her life and her son's, and initially suspect her estranged husband, Graham, a professor at New York University, but he produces an alibi. Susan's case generates attention from the local media, and citizens help in the search by distributing posters. Susan is initially criticized for allowing her son to walk to school by himself. Susan takes a polygraph test that clears her as a suspect. Numerous leads are checked out, including several reports that Alex may have been seen in the back seat of a blue 1965 Chevy. A psychic is also called in, but each lead fizzles. The investigation drags on, and Graham is at odds with Menetti after budget cuts force Menetti to dismantle the command center in Susan's apartment and run the case from the precinct. Menetti's attention is soon diverted to other cases, but the Selky case is always a priority. At one point, Graham takes matters into his own hands after he receives a ransom call. Given a beating, he requires a hospital stay. A break in the case finally happens on the Fourth of July, when Susan's housecleaner, Philippe, is arrested as a suspect. A pair of Alex's bloody underpants was found in his apartment, where the gay Philippe was picked up with a 14-year-old male prostitute. Susan visits Philippe in jail, and he tells her that the bloody underpants came about when he used them to stop...

If you don't want to approach the guy directly, talk to other people who know him or the girl he likes. Check to see if they're dating yet, so you can decide if it's a good idea to try to date him yourself. For instance, try asking a mutual friend this question: \\"Hey, you know Chris? Is he dating Jess?\\" If you're on speaking terms with the guy, ask him about her. You could poke around to see if he plans on asking her out or if he just thinks she's cute. That way, you can figure out if it's a good idea to start dating him or not.  For example, you could say, \\"So you think Rachel is cute? Are you thinking about asking her out?\\" If he's planning on asking her out, you may not want to get involved. He may be too emotionally invested in this other girl to really pay attention to you.  If you don't want to ask him directly, look for clues. If he spends a lot of time with her and talks about her a lot, he may be getting ready to ask her out. Even if the guy likes the other girl and they're dating, that doesn't mean he can't date other people. If both he and the girl agree on it, they may both be seeing other people. You can ask the guy outright or check around to find out more. For instance, you could ask the guy, \\"Are you two still seeing other people?\\" You don't want to be the girl who tries to break up a couple so you can date the guy.

Until he breaks up with her or vice versa, consider him off-limits. Even if you think you're meant for each other, keep in mind this person has flaws like anyone else.

Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Definition: In this task, you are given commands (in terms of logical operations) and natural interpretation of the given command to select relevant rows from the given table. Your job is to generate a label \\"yes\\" if the interpretation is appropriate for the command, otherwise generate label \\"no\\".   Here are the definitions of logical operators:   1. count: returns the number of rows in the view.   2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view.   3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row.   4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments.   5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column.   6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column.   7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column.   8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column.   9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal.   10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance.   11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument.   12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments.   13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument.   14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument.   15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument.   16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table   17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.   20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. Input: Command: most_eq { all_rows ; league cup ; 0 }, interpretation: for the league cup records of all rows , most of them are equal to 0 . Output:","output":"Part #1: Identify the command and its arguments. Usage: The command is \\"most_eq\\" with arguments { all_rows; league cup; 0 }. From the definition, \\"most_eq\\" checks if most of the values under the header column (league cup in this case) are equal to the third argument (0 in this case). The given interpretation explains that we will look at all rows under the header \\"league cup\\" to check if most of them are equal to 0. Part #2: Interpretation of the input. Usage: The interpretation to select relevant rows is \\"for the league cup records of all rows, most of them are equal to 0.\\" We will look at all the rows in the table and their \\"league cup\\" values to see if most of them are equal to 0. Based on the definition, this matches the command and its arguments. Conclusion: Since the given input has broken down the definition and provided a clear interpretation that is closely related to the command and its arguments, the output generated would be \\"yes\\"."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

How is \\"Archive files are unpacked during installation.\\" said in Russian?","output":"In Russian, the sentence \\"Archive files are unpacked during installation\\" can be translated as \\"Архивные файлы распаковываются во время установки.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the sentence: 1. Архивные (arhivnye) - This is the adjective form of the word \\"архив\\" (archive) and it means \\"archive\\" or \\"archival\\" in English. It's used in this sentence to describe the files as archive files. In Russian adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. In this case, \\"архивные\\" agrees with the plural noun \\"файлы\\". 2. файлы (faily) - This is the plural form of the noun \\"файл\\" (file), which translates to \\"files\\" in English. This word is the main subject of the sentence, and it refers to the archive files being unpacked. 3. распаковываются (raspakovyvayutsya) - This is the verb \\"распаковывать\\" (to unpack) in its reflexive form \\"распаковываться\\". It is used in the 3rd person plural form, since the subject of the sentence is plural ('files'). The reflexive form is used because the action of the unpacking is happening to the files themselves. 4. во время (vo vremya) - This is a prepositional phrase that translates to \\"during\\" or \\"at the time of\\" in English. It's used here to express the timing of the action - i.e., when the unpacking of the archive files occurs. 5. установки (ustanovki) - This is the genitive form of the noun \\"установка\\" (installation). The genitive case is used here to indicate that the action of the verb (unpacking) is happening during the time of installation. Putting everything together, the sentence \\"Архивные файлы распаковываются во время установки\\" is a correct translation of \\"Archive files are unpacked during installation\\" in Russian."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's examine each of these options. Option 1: Bag A bag can be a good place to store an eyeglasses case; however, bags are often taken out of the home (e.g., to work, school, shopping), so they may not always be immediately available inside the house. Option 2: Desk Storing an eyeglasses case on a desk can work, but there is a risk of it getting lost or pushed aside among other items on the desk, especially if the desk is cluttered. Option 3: Drawer A drawer offers a dedicated space to keep an eyeglasses case safe, protected, and easily accessible. It also helps to maintain a decluttered environment, as the case is stored out of sight when not in use. Option 4: Shirt pocket This option is not practical for an extra eyeglasses case, as shirt pockets are only temporary and highly dependent on whether you're wearing a shirt with a pocket. Additionally, a pocket does not provide much protection for the case. Option 5: Car A car can serve as a convenient place to store an eyeglasses case for emergencies; however, it is not within the confines of a home, which is the location specified in the question. Step 2: Compared the options and justify the reasoning Comparing the options, a drawer is the most fitting option for storing an extra eyeglasses case in a home, as it offers a dedicated, secure, and easily accessible storage place while keeping the home environment tidy.

Instead of helping, the other girls ridicule and harass her, throwing out tampons, sanitary towels and toilet paper to her. Teacher Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) rushes in to stop the commotion. White, who appears to be bottling extreme rage, snaps a light bulb. After questioning Carrie, Miss Collins realizes that Carrie is unaware of the concept of menstruation. Because of this, Miss Collins asks the school principal to excuse Carrie from gym class for a week because of the trauma. Upon her way home, Carrie uses her recently discovered telekinesis to stop a boy from teasing her. While at home, Carrie is tormented by her delusional mother (Piper Laurie), who locks Carrie in a closet and forces her to pray--she believes that Carrie received her period due to sinning.Miss Collins, still livid about the incident, berates the other girls and forces them through a detention, deliberately physically exhausting them. The leader of the clique, Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen), refuses to participate, and as punishment, is banned from the upcoming prom. Furious, she blames Carrie for her misfortune.

Answer the following question: Process: - Electrical signals in the brain travel through nerves to muscles - Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles - The filaments move when the brain instructs them to - The motion of the filaments cause the muscle to shorten and contract - Opposing pairs of muscles exist in order to provide the necessary range of motion.  Question: suppose less water seeps into rocks happens, how will it affect range of motion is caused by muscles.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The question involves two distinct concepts: the process of muscle contraction and the influence of water seepage in rocks. It's essential to address these concepts separately before evaluating any potential connections between them.  First, let's examine the process of muscle contraction as outlined in your question. Muscle contraction occurs due to electrical signals in the brain that travel through nerves to muscles. Within the muscles, two types of proteins exist in filaments: actin and myosin. When the brain instructs the filaments to move, the motion of these filaments causes the muscle to shorten and contract. This process is facilitated by the presence of opposing pairs of muscles, which allow for the necessary range of motion during body movements. Now, let's consider the concept of water seepage in rocks. In geological formations, water seeps into rocks and other porous surfaces. The effect of this water infiltration on the rocks depends on various factors such as the rock type, the rate of water flow, and the overall environmental conditions. Now, let us explore the possible relationship between these two concepts. In the context of this question, it is implied that there may be a connection between water seepage in rocks and the range of motion caused by muscles. However, there isn't any direct correlation between these two events. Water seepage in rocks primarily affects geological structures, whereas the range of motion caused by muscles is primarily a biological process. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the supposed perturbation of less water seeping into rocks would have no effect on the range of motion caused by muscles. Similarly, this perturbation would not influence the opposing pairs of muscles that provide the necessary range of motion. The biological mechanisms responsible for muscle contraction, shortening, and range of motion remain unaffected by geological processes or changes related to water seepage in rocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: People buy tickets on November 28 for the record Powerball jackpot, which swelled to 587.6 million. (CNN) -- The second Powerball ticket holder in last month's record jackpot has come forward to claim winnings worth nearly 200 million before taxes, the Arizona Lottery said Friday. \\"It is difficult to express just how thankful we are for this wonderful gift,\\" said the winner, a married man in his 30s whom the lottery said it would not identify publicly, at his request. \\"We are extremely grateful and feel fortunate to now have an increased ability to support our charities and causes. Obviously, this has been incredibly overwhelming, and we have always cherished our privacy.\\" The message directed reporters to the law firm Rhoads & Sinon LLP in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which did not immediately return a call on Friday night. The winner lives in Fountain Hills, northeast of Phoenix, said Karen Bach, director of budget, communications and products at the Arizona Lottery. He and his wife relocated there about a year ago from Pennsylvania and had played Powerball in Arizona only twice, she said. The 587.6 million jackpot from the November 28 drawing had a cash option of 384.7 million before taxes. The Arizona winner has opted to take cash, 192.5 million, before taxes. Fake lottery winner may be Facebook's most shared photo On the day of the drawing, he went to 4 Sons Food Store in Fountain Hills, \\"handed the clerk a 20 bill and he said, 'I'd like 10 in Quick Pick Powerball tickets,'\\" she told reporters. \\"The retailer tried to encourage him to spend the entire 20 and he said, 'No, 10 is all I want to spend.' Clearly, that was enough.\\" He left his ticket overnight on the sun visor in his vehicle and retrieved it the next day, after he and his wife heard there had been a winner in Arizona. Then they compared the numbers on the ticket against those posted on the lottery website, she said. \\"They checked the numbers over and over again and were just absolutely shocked,\\" Bach said. Since then, the couple has assembled a legal and financial team to guide them through the process and began meeting with them on Monday, going so far as to use a whiteboard to write down how they wanted to allocate their newfound assets, Bach said. Columns on the whiteboard included entries for financial, legal and \\"fun,\\" she said. The couple opted to claim the prize before the end of the year \\"because of concerns over the fiscal cliff in 2013,\\" she said. The winnings are to be awarded on about December 14, said Jeff Hatch-Miller, executive director of the Arizona Lottery. Hatch-Miller, who met Friday morning with the winner in a hotel suite in Scottsdale, said the winner likes what he does and has no immediate plans to change it. \\"The winner said, 'You know, I like my job; I'd like to continue working my job,'\\" Hatch-Miller said. He described the man's work as \\"just a regular job, like yours or mine -- it's not a high-level job.\\" The winner's anonymity is not likely to last. A spokeswoman for the Arizona Lottery, Cindy Esquer, said it would release his name on Monday to news organizations that file Freedom of Information Act requests for it. Two winners from Missouri claimed their half of the jackpot on November 30. The prize is considered income by the IRS, meaning that the highest federal tax rate of 35% will apply. Each winner would therefore owe 67 million to the IRS, said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at tax research firm CCH, in an interview last month. State taxes will also apply. In Arizona, a resident who has the winning ticket will be charged a 5% tax on the prize money. If a non-resident bought the winning ticket, a 6% rate will apply. The resulting tax bill will be either 10 million or 11 million, according to CCH. Ohio cops share 1million Powerball prize Missouri charges residents and non-residents a 4% tax, making the tax liability there nearly 8 million. Taking both state and federal taxes into consideration means the Arizona winner would owe up to 78 million in taxes and take home 114 million. The Missouri winner's tax bill would total about 75 million, leaving a take of 117.5 million. However, in either case, the amount paid in state taxes could likely be deducted on the winners' federal tax returns, lowering the overall tax liability slightly.","output":"\\"Privacy-Cherishing Couple Claims 200M Share of Record 587.6M Powerball Jackpot\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is the recipient of three National Film Awards, 12 Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards, four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards, two Filmfare Special Awards, Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and many more. Context: In the 1950s, Mangeshkar sang songs composed by various music directors of the period, including Anil Biswas (in films such as Tarana and Heer), Shankar Jaikishan, Naushad Ali, S. D. Burman, Pandit Amarnath Husan Lal Bhagat Ram (in films like Bari Behan, Meena Bazaar, Afsana, Aadhi Raat, Ansoo, Chhoti Bhabi, Adal-e-Jehangir), C. Ramchandra, Hemant Kumar, Salil Chowdhury, Khayyam, Ravi, Sajjad Hussain, Roshan, Kalyanji-Anandji, Vasant Desai, Sudhir Phadke, Hansraj Behl, Madan Mohan, and Usha Khanna. She made her debut in Tamil playback singing with Vanaradham in 1956 (Uran Khotala dubbed in Tamil) with the Tamil song \\"Enthan Kannalan\\" picturised on Nimmi in the dubbed version composed by Naushad.  Mangeshkar sang many raga-based songs for Naushad in movies such as Deedar (1951), Baiju Bawra (1952), Amar (1954), Uran Khatola (1955) and Mother India (1957). Ae Chorre Ki Jaat Badi Bewafa, a duet with G. M. Durrani, was her first song for composer, Naushad. The duo, Shankar-Jaikishan, chose Mangeshkar for Barsaat (1949), Aah (1953), Shree 420 (1955) and Chori Chori (1956). Before 1957, composer S. D. Burman chose Mangeshkar as the leading female singer for his musical scores in Sazaa (1951), House No. 44 (1955), and Devdas (1955). However a rift developed between Lata and Burman in 1957, and Lata did not sing Burman's compositions again until 1962.

Choose how you want this story to end. (CNN) -- With her signature Friday on Senate Bill 1070, Gov. Jan Brewer launched Arizona into a maelstrom of national controversy, community conflict and extreme fiscal risk. In doing so, she failed a basic test of courageous leadership -- recognizing and acting responsibly when political symbolism and populist pandering crosses into dangerous policy. The governor should have known better, if only because recent history demonstrates the folly in enacting measures like Arizona's SB 1070. SB 1070 will be subject to multiple legal challenges, and the state will devote precious resources to defend a law that has so many serious constitutional flaws that it will likely never be implemented. The neighboring state of California faced this circumstance 15 years ago when Gov. Pete Wilson championed Proposition 187, enacted by voters in November 1994. They and other proponents have at various times maintained, in more or less blatant contradiction of their rhetorical defense of the law's constitutional propriety, that SB 1070 is a much-needed change in current law that will strengthen OPTIONS: - Arizona. - CNN. - California. - Jan Brewer. - Pete Wilson. - Prop. - Proposition 187. - SB 1070. - Saenz. - Senate Bill 1070. - Thomas Saenz.","output":"Arizona's SB 1070 is a much-needed change in current law that will strengthen the state's efforts to maintain public safety and ensure the well-being of its residents. Although the bill has faced numerous challenges and sparked heated debate across the nation, the story can end with a positive outcome for Arizona through education, cooperation, and proper implementation of the law. The signing of SB 1070 by Gov. Jan Brewer marks a significant milestone in Arizona's history. The state has become an epicenter of immigration issues, and the enactment of this legislation has elicited strong emotions from both supporters and opponents. To ensure a successful implementation, it is crucial for the government and the community to foster a dialogue for understanding, compromise, and mutual respect. Understanding the reasons behind the law and the potential benefits it can provide will help mitigate the fear and apprehension felt by many. In order to proceed, it is essential for the state’s law-enforcement agencies to receive thorough training on the implementation of SB 1070. This comprehensive education will enable officers to carry out their duties responsibly and within the confines of the Constitution. Ensuring that racial profiling is not used unlawfully or unethically during the law enforcement process will be a critical factor in maintaining the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Moreover, continuous dialogue between the government, communities, and activists regarding the benefits and flaws of the law can help design better ways to collaborate. This constructive exchange of ideas can address the concerns of all parties involved, ultimately leading to a more efficient system for addressing immigration and public safety issues. Additionally, by working together with its neighboring states like California, who have previously dealt with controversial immigration legislatives such as Proposition 187, Arizona can learn from past successes and failures. This cooperative effort could result in a more effective implementation by using evidence-based best practices while reducing unnecessary expenditure in costly legal battles. In conclusion, the signing of SB 1070 by Gov. Jan Brewer marks the beginning of a new chapter in Arizona's history of dealing with immigration issues. By promoting understanding, cooperation, and proper implementation of the law, the state can work towards achieving its goals of maintaining public safety and addressing the concerns of all parties involved. This story can end on a positive note with Arizona leading the way in effective immigration policy for the United States, ultimately inspiring other states to follow suit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Joanna la Beltraneja, born in 1462, the first and only daughter of King Henry IV of Castile, was of Asturias. A rumour spread that Princess Joanna was not actually the daughter of King Henry but rather of Beltrán de la Cueva, the alleged lover of Queen Joan of Portugal. Joanna was thus nicknamed \\"la Beltraneja\\", as a mocking reference to her assumed father. Pressure from members of the nobility forced the King to strip her of the title and name his half-brother Alfonso as heir, in 1464. In 1465, a group of nobility assembled in Ávila and overthrew King Henry, replacing him with Alfonso. That led to a war that ended in 1468 with the death of the 14-year-old Alfonso. Henry IV regained the throne, but the title of heir became disputed between Joanna, his daughter, and Isabella, his half-sister. That was resolved via the Treaty of the Bulls of Guisando, which gave Isabella succession rights but restricted her marriage options. Isabella secretly married Ferdinand in 1469 at the age of 17, ignoring Henry IV's wishes. Gradually, the couple gained a larger number of supporters and obtained a papal bull sanctioning their marriage from Pope Sixtus IV in 1472 and gained the support of the powerful Mendoza family in 1473. When Henry IV died in December 1474, both candidates for the throne were proclaimed Queen of Castile by their respective supporters. Aware of their position of weakness against Isabella's supporters, Joanna's supporters proposed for the 43-year-old King Afonso V of Portugal, a widower for some 20 years, to marry Joanna, his niece, and assume the throne of Castile with her.

Anglesey is also the largest island in the Irish Sea by area, and the second most populous island in the Irish Sea (after the Isle of Man). The population at the 2011 census was 69,751. Two bridges span the Menai Strait, connecting the island to the mainland: the Menai Suspension Bridge, designed by Thomas Telford in 1826, and the Britannia Bridge.  - The Angles were one of the main Germanic peoples who settled in Britain in the post-Roman period. They founded several of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England, and their name is the root of the name \\"England\\". The name comes from the district of Angeln, an area located on the Baltic shore of what is now Schleswig-Holstein.    What is the relationship between 'cribinau' and 'irish sea'? A:","output":"Cribinau is a small tidal island off the south west coast of the Isle of Anglesey in Wales. The Irish Sea is the body of water that separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain, and Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea. The relationship between Cribinau and the Irish Sea is that Cribinau is an island located within the Irish Sea, off the coast of Anglesey, which is also situated in the Irish Sea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Nobody gets out the bunting for sixth place, but there is more to Liverpool’s inch-by-inch pro-gress up the table than first sight suggests. This win edged them past Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, but the gap now separating Liverpool from clubs with loftier ambitions is increasingly small. They are a point behind Southampton, whose bubble may be about to pop, two points off Manchester United in fourth, three points away from Arsenal in third. Inferior goal difference means Liverpool will need to go that extra yard but, on this form, it is well within their power. They scored with their first two shots on target in this game, the second in the 73rd minute, but that should not detract from the display. Southampton had three first-half penalty appeals — one of which was particularly convincing — but this was a gutsy, impressive win on a day that made it impossible to play the brand of football that is the trademark of manager Brendan Rodgers. Liverpool playmaker Phillipe Coutinho strikes from outside the area to put his side ahead in the third minute. Coutinho (centre) celebrates with his Liverpool team-mates after putting his side in front against Southampton. Here's how it happened - our graphic shows the speed and distance of Coutinho's superb early opener for the Reds at St Mary's. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling then made it 2-0 in the second half against Southampton at St Mary's.

Philippe Coutinho's superb opener for Liverpool. CLICK HERE for more from Sportsmail's excellent Match Zone. Liverpool had to tough it out instead, and did. In a spoiling swirl of wind and driving rain, not to mention strength-sapping bitter cold, they dug in against the formidable aerial power of Graziano Pelle, and the midfield worked hard. They have now kept five consecutive clean sheets away from home in the league — a record unmatched since 1985, the days of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson. No, it wasn’t the prettiest, but it was never going to be, and Philippe Coutinho’s first goal at least was a thing of beauty. It was fitting that it should take place in front of local hero Matt Le Tissier, too. It will not have greatly pleased him — he is too much of a Southampton loyalist for that — but he would surely have admired the artistry and the technique. Lazar Markovic slipped a simple pass inside to Coutinho and he turned it into something truly magnificent with a curling shot from 30 yards. Le Tissier scored a few like that and it may have jogged his memory as Coutinho’s effort bent perfectly beyond the reach of Fraser Forster, struck the underside of the bar and bounced down over the line, as if the ball itself knew a degree of aesthetic flamboyance was required for such a finish. That was after just three minutes, and 70 had passed by the time Liverpool struck their next shot on target, again with success. The fact that Southampton’s usually pin-sharp defence made not one, but two mistakes, on the way to goal illustrates the job that Liverpool had done by then. soaking up the pressure and leaving them exhausted. Coutinho struck a superb effort from 25 yards which left Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster helpless. Southampton goalkeeper Forster could do nothing as he was beaten by the Brazilian's excellent finish. Coutinho (right) celebrates with team-mates Lazar Markovic (left), Sterling (second left) and Joe Allen. Former Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana (left) is tackled by Steven Davis of Southampton at St Mary's. What did Graham Poll make of the declined penalty appeals? Find out here. One would never have guessed it was Liverpool that had played a European game as recently as Thursday. Southampton substitute Morgan Schneiderlin played a careless square ball directly to Alberto Moreno, whose forward run ended with a cross which should have been cleared by Matt Targett. Instead, off-balance, he tapped it helplessly to Raheem Sterling, who drove the ball through a crowd of players, goalkeeper Forster unsighted until it was too late. So nothing to celebrate yet, but suddenly Liverpool have options. When Rodgers left out Daniel Sturridge many felt it was a sign he was prioritising the Europa League as the best entry route to next season’s Champions League. Not after this. If it was even half in Rodgers’s mind that the small number of set-pieces required to secure cup qualification might prove less of an obstacle than an assault on a top four, he can now afford to play both ends. Manchester United must be worried. Squeezed by Arsenal and Southampton, and now Liverpool, the league is their only route back. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers directs his players in the rain on the touchline in front of Southampton boss Ronald Koeman (right) Liverpool's teenage winger Jordon Ibe attempts to take the ball past Southampton youngster Matt Targett. Filip Djuricic of Southampton is caught in a sandwich between Dejan Lovren (top) and Joe Allen. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet rushes out to the edge of his area to block a shot from Southampton's Eljero Elia. And what of Southampton, pace-setters, fairy-tale, the Champions League choice of all football romantics? It is going to be hard going from here. Southampton have won one game in the last five in all competitions and Sunday’s display fizzled out into a standard hard- luck story of penalty appeals denied. They didn’t play poorly, but they didn’t convince, either, and the feeling of injustice that permeated St Mary’s obscures a dip in form. Southampton look leggy and their threat reduced as the game wore on. The filthy weather that plagued the south coast made flowing football a forlorn hope, so no wonder much of Southampton’s threat came from balls in the air, won by Pelle, who was a handful without being a threat. Liverpool do not care for that option, as Rodgers made plain on the day he told Andy Carroll he had no future at the club. Even so, the real enemy, according to the locals, was not the rain or the wind but referee Kevin Friend, who rejected four penalty appeals. That the first came after just 25 seconds created a feeling of injustice to rival that felt by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. Friend, who is having a weekend of it, was the fourth official at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, too. New signing Filip Djuricic, on his debut, was the first to fail to convince Friend, putting Emre Can under pressure from the opening attack of the game. Can certainly seemed to place a hand on his shoulder, and not in a fatherly way, but not with the force needed to make Djuricic collapse as he did. The ease with which he went down probably got Can off the hook. Maybe Djuricic, on loan from Benfica, would have swayed official judgment in Portugal’s league, but not here. The second was more convincing, Joe Allen bringing down Djuricic only to find Friend curiously unmoved. The ball ran free to Eljero Elia, who forced Simon Mignolet to make a fine save, overlooked in the furore. Liverpool forward Sterling is tackled by Southampton defender Jose Fonte at St Mary's while goalkeeper Forster watches on. Dejan Lovren (left) appears to handle the ball in an incident which saw Southampton unsuccessfully appeal for a penalty. Southampton forward Eljero Elia charges forward with the ball as he battles with Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel (right) Only Fraser Forster (12) and Ben Foster (West Brom, 10) have kept more Premier League clean sheets this season than Simon Mignolet (nine). A final penalty appeal was made against Can, for handball, just before half-time but there was a growing feeling of resignation about Southampton’s desperate pleas. Seconds earlier, they were making a strong case for a free-kick just outside the box. A long pass sent Elia through and Mignolet came charging from his line, intercepting with inches to spare on the edge of the area. It hit his body inside, but perhaps a hand outside, although it is hard to see how Friend could have made a handball call with any certainty. TV replays were not totally clear initially, suggesting his reluctance was justified. Even if video technology is allowed it is unlikely to clear up incidents such as this in the time allotted. Sterling had one rejected at the other end, too, but it appeared Jose Fonte got the ball. Even if he hadn’t, it is hard to imagine Friend pointing to the spot. Maybe he’s just the sceptical type. A view of the action during the clash between Southampton and Liverpool at a rainy St Mary's on Sunday afternoon. Liverpool forward Sterling struck from inside the penalty area to make it 2-0 as Morgan Schneiderlin (left) tried to prevent him.

In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \\"would make us stronger legally and musically\\", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of 11,000. Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out-of-practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: \\"I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate.\\" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: \\"Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all.\\" Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album.Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name.

It's a crucial period for both parents and their daughters as they navigate the complexities of growth and self-discovery. Dr. Helen Wright, an expert in child development and family dynamics, has recently published a guidebook aimed at helping parents better understand and support their teenage daughters. In this article, we will discuss the key takeaways from Dr. Wright's advice on fostering a healthy and supportive environment for teenage girls. 1. Be a Good Role Model for Your Daughter: One of the most important things a parent can do for their teenage daughter is to be a positive role model. This includes demonstrating healthy behaviors, such as respectful communication, emotional intelligence, and responsible decision-making. By embodying these qualities, parents encourage their daughters to also adopt these traits, which will benefit them throughout their lives. 2. Help Her Deal with Peer Pressure: Peer pressure is an inevitable part of adolescence, and it can be a significant challenge for teenage girls. Parents should be aware of the possible negative influences their daughters may face and actively support and guide them to make good decisions. Providing an open and non-judgmental environment for communication, asking about their friends and social activities, and actively listening to their concerns are all crucial steps in helping girls resist peer pressure. 3. Accept That Mood Swings are Normal: The teenage years are marked by hormonal changes and emotional turbulence. Dr. Wright emphasizes that parents should accept and be prepared for mood swings as a natural part of their daughter's development. Instead of dismissing them, offering support and empathy during challenging times will help strengthen the parent-daughter bond. 4. Avoid Fad Diets and Encourage a Healthy Relationship with Food: Many teenage girls may feel pressured to conform to societal ideals of beauty, which may lead to unhealthy eating habits and body image issues. Dr. Wright advises mothers to avoid fad diets and instead promote a healthy, balanced approach to food. By modeling positive eating habits and focusing on overall health rather than appearance, parents can help their daughters develop a healthy relationship with their bodies and food. 5. Don't \\"Hide\\" Your Body or Promote Body Shame: Lastly, Dr. Wright emphasizes the importance of transparency and openly embracing one's body, regardless of its shape and size. Parents who \\"hide\\" their bodies inadvertently send a message to their daughters that they should be ashamed of their own. By embracing and maintaining a positive body image, parents can encourage their daughters to also accept and love themselves just as they are. Conclusion: Navigating the teenage years with a daughter is a rewarding, yet challenging experience for both parties. Dr. Helen Wright's guidebook offers parents invaluable advice to help them better understand and support their growing girls. By implementing these strategies, parents can help create a supportive and nurturing environment that will empower their teenage daughters to develop into confident, self-assured young women."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Cliff and Laurie Henderson and their daughter, Jill, are relocating to Tokyo and decide to sail there on board the ship. A fire in the boiler room is extinguished, but not before a boiler fuel supply valve is fused open. Before Chief Engineer Pringle can manually open a steam relief valve, a huge explosion rips through the boiler room and the many decks situated above it, killing him and some of the passengers and trapping Laurie under a steel beam in their state room, in addition to opening a huge hole in the side of the ship.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  Most historians describe the contacts between the Mongol Empire and the Western Europeans as a series of attempts, missed opportunities, and failed negotiations. Christopher Atwood, in the 2004 Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, summed up the relations between Western Europe and the Mongols: \\"Despite numerous envoys and the obvious logic of an alliance against mutual enemies, the papacy and the Crusaders never achieved the often-proposed alliance against Islam.\\"A few other historians argue there was an actual alliance, but do not agree on the details: Jean Richard wrote that an alliance began around 1263. Reuven Amitai stated that the closest thing to actual Mongol-Frankish military coordination was when Prince Edward of England attempted to coordinate activities with Abaga in 1271. Amitai also mentioned the other attempts towards cooperation, but said, \\"In none of these episodes, however, can we speak of Mongols and troops from the Frankish West being on the Syrian mainland at the same time.\\" Timothy May described the alliance as having its peak at the Council of Lyon in 1274, but that it began to unravel in 1275 with the death of Bohemond, and May too admitted that the forces never engaged in joint operations. Alain Demurger, in his own book The Last Templar, said that an alliance was not sealed until 1300.There also continues to be debate about whether or not an alliance would have been a wise idea, and whether the Crusaders at that point in history were even relevant to the Persian-Mongol conflict. The 20th-century historian Glenn Burger said, \\"The refusal of the Latin Christian states in the area to follow Hethum's example and adapt to changing conditions by allying themselves with the new Mongol empire must stand as one of the saddest of the many failures of Outremer.\\" This was similar to the view of Steven Runciman, who argued, \\"Had the Mongol alliance been achieved and honestly implemented by the West, the existence of Outremer would almost certainly have been prolonged.

Doctors say obesity,also known as severe overweight,is a complex condition.A doctor may advise medical interventions in addition to changes in behavior.But experts say the more successful weightloss plans include a wellbalanced diet and exercise.  People who want to avoid weight gain have to balance the number of calories they eat with the number of calories they use.To lose weight,you can reduce the number of calories you take in,or increase the number you use,or both.Experts at the National Institutes of Health say to lose weight,a person should do some moderate or intensive physical exercise most days of the week.This could include fast walking,sports or strength training.  A recent study looked at four of the most popular dieting plans in the United States.Researchers at Stanford University studied more than three hundred overweight women,mostly in their thirties or forties.Each woman went on one of the four plans:Atkins,The Zone,Ornish or LEARN.The women attended diet classes and received written information about the food plans.At the end of a year,the women on the Atkins diet had lost the most,more than four and a half kilograms on average.  Christopher Gardner led the study,reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He said the Atkins diet may be more successful because of its simple message to lower the intake of sugar.Also,he said the advice to increase protein in the diet leads to more satisfying meals.

Please answer this question: Who played 'Gandhi' in the film of the same name?","output":"The actor who portrayed 'Gandhi' in the film of the same name is Sir Ben Kingsley. Ben Kingsley, who was born Krishna Pandit Bhanji on December 31, 1943, in Snainton, England, played the lead role of Mahatma Gandhi in the critically acclaimed film. 'Gandhi' is a 1982 biographical historical drama film directed by Richard Attenborough, and it documents the life and times of the famed Indian independence leader, Mahatma Gandhi. Ben Kingsley's riveting performance in the film was lauded by critics and audiences alike. His portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi, from young adulthood to his final days in the epic struggle for Indian independence, is considered one of the finest performances in cinematic history. Kingsley meticulously prepared for the role by losing weight, adopting Indian lifestyle practices, and studying intensive research materials about Gandhi's personal life and political career. In fact, his portrayal of Gandhi is considered so accurate that many people who had personally met or interacted with Mahatma Gandhi praised Kingsley for his captivating and faithful representation. Kingsley's outstanding performance in 'Gandhi' earned him numerous awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1983, a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama. The film itself went on to achieve great success – both critically and commercially – winning eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Attenborough. This film and Kingsley's portrayal of Gandhi solidified his status as one of the finest actors of his generation, leading to a long and illustrious career in film and television for the British actor. Some of his other notable roles include acclaimed performances in 'Schindler's List,' 'Sexy Beast,' 'House of Sand and Fog,' and 'Iron Man 3,' among many others. In 2002, Ben Kingsley was honored with a knighthood in recognition of his exceptional contributions to the arts and entertainment industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Early one morning, more than a hundred years ago, an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep. He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed  and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day. However, the unconscious part expresses itself through its own logic and its own language.. It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first. This is why dreams are sometimes called \\"secret messages to ourselves\\". Question: According to the passage, Elias Howe was  _  . Options: A: much more hard-working than other inventors B: the first person who solved problems while sleeping C: the first person at the time who knew the value of dreams D: the first person to design a sewing machine that really worked The answer is:","output":"D: the first person to design a sewing machine that really worked"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the name of the album that was left unaltered aside from a remastering which sharpened the bass guitar sound and increased the volume of the vocals by approximately three decibels?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album.  Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \\"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label.  All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it.  A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\\".  While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did.  Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous  [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard.  Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind).  Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement.  Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic.  The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993.  Furthermore, a remix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is the same mix that appeared on the single.... Answer:","output":"The album you are referring to is \\"In Utero\\" by Nirvana. The band decided to remix and augment the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" with producer Scott Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993, while the rest of the album was left unaltered aside from a remastering which sharpened the bass guitar sound and increased the volume of the vocals by approximately three decibels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The organization is responsible for promoting and developing the sport globally, coordinating international events and competitions, and establishing standard rules and guidelines to ensure fair play. One of the most notable events associated with the World Croquet Federation is the MacRobertson Shield. The MacRobertson Shield is a prestigious international croquet competition that was first held in 1925. It is the oldest and most renowned tournament in the sport of croquet, featuring the best teams from around the world. Initially, the MacRobertson Shield was contested between Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. However, since 1993, the United States has also participated in the tournament. The MacRobertson Shield is played using the \\"Association Croquet\\" version of the game, which follows specific rules and tactics different from those of the more commonly known garden croquet. Association Croquet requires a higher degree of skill, strategy, and precision than its garden counterpart, making it more appealing for serious players and competitive tournaments like the MacRobertson Shield. Throughout the years, the World Croquet Federation has continued to evolve and expand, now encompassing over 30 member countries across various continents. These countries actively participate in managing the organization, hosting events, and promoting the sport within their territories.

She blu-tacked page threes above her bed-head and had me snap topless Polaroids till they littered the floor. She told me to imagine she had 36DDs and peroxide blonde hair. I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were. Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right. Keith wasn't rolling in spare change so Trisha's step-dad took the Cortina as payment in lieu of her getting herself fixed up. Trisha got me to stash the Cortina up the lane at the back of Boyes' farm.

They challenged the legality of restraint methods used against them in April 2009 when they were contained by officers in Bishopsgate. But the Court of Appeal has now ruled against the High Court's decision. Mr Moos said it was \\"a shame\\" the appeal judges could not see that the police were \\"out of control\\". The High Court ruling, where officers were said to have used \\"unjustified force\\", led to a call from human rights lawyers for an \\"immediate change to police attitudes and tactics\\". Police used the kettling tactic - where demonstrators are corralled inside police cordons and prevented from leaving - against the protesters in Bishopsgate, even though they had been peaceful. The Met said the kettling was necessary to keep violent demonstrators at the Royal Exchange from \\"hijacking\\" the more peaceful climate camp, attended by up to 5,000 people. The High Court had ruled there had been no evidence of an imminent breach of the peace to justify the kettle, which was in place for more than four hours. Mr Moos, who was part of a peaceful protest camp, said he had become dehydrated after being refused permission to leave. When the police announced an appeal they made it clear the judgement did not outlaw kettling, and containment tactics would continue to be used \\"to prevent serious disorder and violence\\". The Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger, sitting in the Court of Appeal with Lord Justice Hughes and Lord Justice Sullivan, ruled against the High Court decision. In his ruling, Lord Neuberger said the Met's appeal was being allowed because the Divisional Court (High Court) had \\"applied the wrong test when assessing whether there was an imminent risk of breach of the peace\\". Rather than assessing the \\"reasonableness\\" of the view taken by the officer in charge on the day, the High Court judges had formed their own view, the Court of Appeal heard. \\"Even if they decided that (the officer's) view was unreasonable, there was no valid basis for reaching such a decision,\\" said Lord Neuberger. The decision to contain the crowd of protesters at the climate camp was justifiable because of fears of the serious risk of them being joined by \\"dispersing demonstrators from another substantial crowd\\" which had been seriously violent and disorderly, the court heard. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, welcomed the verdict, saying: \\"As the August riots and student protests highlighted last year, in order to appropriately respond to a situation of disorder, police must have available to them a wide array of tactics.\\" He said clear parameters were needed so that in the future both protesters and police officers know when kettling methods would be used. A summary of the above article is?","output":"The Court of Appeal has overturned a previous High Court ruling regarding the legality of police \\"kettling\\" tactics used on protesters during the Bishopsgate demonstrations in 2009.

The High Court had ruled that there was no evidence of an imminent breach of the peace to justify the kettling tactic, calling for an immediate change to police attitudes and tactics. However, the Court of Appeal disagreed, stating that the High Court had applied the wrong test when assessing if there was an imminent risk of a breach of the peace. The verdict supports the continued use of containment tactics by the police to prevent serious disorder and violence during protests.

If there isn't any food other than candy, what type of store is he probably in?  Choices:  - department store - gas station - grocery store - drugstore - supermarket  The rationale to choose \\"drugstore\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The aisle with over the counter medication is one of the strongest indicators that John might be in a drugstore. Additionally, the presence of assorted items, toys, and candy also suggests that the store offers goods beyond just medications and pharmaceutical products, which is typical for a drugstore. Drugstores often stock a variety of products, including non-prescription medicines, health and beauty items, small toys, greeting cards and, of course, candy. Now, let's examine the other choices to further establish why \\"drugstore\\" is the most appropriate answer: 1. Department Store: These stores typically sell a wide range of products, including clothing, electronics, and home goods. While they may carry some over the counter medications, this wouldn't be the primary focus of their inventory. Additionally, the fact that there doesn't appear to be food other than candy also makes it unlikely that John is in a department store, as these stores often have a food department or an area with pre-packaged snacks, unlike a drugstore. 2. Gas Station: While gas stations can sometimes carry a small selection of over the counter medications and assorted items, they generally wouldn't have an entire aisle dedicated to medication. Their primary purpose is to provide fuel and other car-related services, with convenience items available for purchase. The limited food options, specifically only candy, also doesn't rule out the gas station, but the emphasis on medications makes it less likely than a drugstore. 3. Grocery Store: A grocery store focuses primarily on selling food products, and while they do typically have an aisle for over the counter medications, their inventory concentrates on various food items. The fact that John doesn't see any food other than candy strongly suggests that he isn't in a grocery store. 4. Supermarket: Supermarkets are essentially larger versions of grocery stores, with an extensive range of food products and a broader selection of household items, including over the counter medications. However, just like with grocery stores, the absence of food other than candy indicates that John is not in a supermarket. Taking all of this into account, the answer \\"drugstore\\" makes the most sense. The presence of an aisle dedicated to over the counter medications, along with the fact that the store offers various non-food items, lends itself to the idea that John is in a drugstore. The absence of food products other than candy further supports this conclusion, given the typically limited food selection in drugstores. Thus, the rationale for choosing \\"drugstore\\" as the answer is based on the specific features of the store, such as the medication aisle and the variety of non-food items available, as well as the exclusion of other options based on their distinguishing characteristics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a premise: Nothing could more aptly epitomize the Mutiny's good and bad results, from an Indian point of view, than the name given to the legislation that was to  the 1858 Act for Better Government of India. Here is a hypothesis: The Better Government did, ultimately, make India a better place to live. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis in relation to the premise, it is essential to critically discuss both concepts, as well as relevant context and evidence. Premise: The 1858 Act for the Better Government of India was enacted following the Mutiny - a turning point in the history of British rule in India. This event, also known as the First War of Indian Independence or the Indian Rebellion of 1857, was a large-scale uprising against British rule in India. It is crucial to understand that this legislation was intended to address the dissatisfaction in Indian society at the time, which had arisen due to numerous factors, including political, social, economic, and religious grievances. Hypothesis: If the Better Government in India did indeed make the country a better place to live, it would be necessary to weigh this statement against several criteria, such as improvements in political, social, economic, and religious arenas. This evaluation could help determine the overall impact on the lives of people in India. To address the relationship between the premise and hypothesis to assess the validity of the hypothesis, it is useful to consider key changes implemented by the 1858 Act and their effects in the context of India during that time. 1. Political changes: The Act brought about several fundamental political changes, such as the end of the East India Company's rule and the beginning of direct British rule under the British Crown. As India officially became a colony of the British Empire, the Secretary of State for India was appointed to handle administrative affairs, with the Viceroy as the highest-ranking British official in India. This change symbolizes a more prominent and direct British involvement in the governance of India, which could have potentially improved the country's administration. 2. Social changes: The Act led to better interaction between the British and Indian society. A fundamental aspect of the Act was the 'Doctrine of Lapse' policy, which prohibited the adoption of an heir by an Indian ruler who dies without a natural heir. The purpose of this policy was to prevent Indian rulers from maintaining control over their territories, thus enabling the British to expand their empire. Despite this, the British became more cautious in their rule and sought to respect the socio-cultural customs of Indians. 3. Economic changes: Under the Act, India's economy became more integrated with Britain. The British developed India's infrastructure, including railways, telegraphs, and postal services. As a result, trade increased between Britain and India as well as greater communication and transportation facilitated by these advancements. However, the benefits of this economic development had varying impacts on the people in India, with some people in certain regions benefitting more than others. 4. Religious changes: One of the aftermaths of the mutiny was that the British recognized the importance of respecting religious sentiments of Indians. They became cautious in interfering with local religious practices and traditions. This led to efforts to ensure religious and cultural sensitivities were acknowledged, promoting a more inclusive administration. In conclusion, it is challenging to universally determine whether the hypothesis that the Better Government made India a better place to live holds true. The premise highlights the changes brought about by the 1858 Act for the Better Government of India, while the hypothesis assumes a positive overall impact. Although the Act led to substantial political, social, economic, and religious changes and addressed some shortcomings exposed in the aftermath of the Mutiny, whether these changes were ultimately beneficial depends on the perspectives and experiences of different sections of the Indian population. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is not absolute; the hypothesis may be true for some, and not for others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: Why was RealClearPolitics involved?

Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B took them to an ecological site where they wouldn't affect ground water and spread disease.  Which town is experiencing more groundwater contamination?  Hint: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7] A:","output":"Town A is likely experiencing more groundwater contamination due to their conventional disposal of biomedical waste in a regular dump site for 10 years, as opposed to Town B's eco-friendly waste management practices. Biomedical waste poses significant dangers to the environment, public health, and the community. It consists of infectious materials, sharps, toxic chemicals, and radioactive elements. When this hazardous waste is mixed with municipal waste or disposed of improperly into regular dump sites, the risks of groundwater contamination and the spread of diseases increase. In Town A, the disposal of biomedical waste in regular dump sites allows the waste to leach into the soil and, eventually, the groundwater. Groundwater, an essential source of drinking water and irrigation, becomes contaminated with harmful chemicals, toxins, and infectious agents that result from the decomposition of this waste. Contaminated groundwater can lead to waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever. Moreover, residents in the area may experience higher rates of respiratory problems, skin infections, and other illnesses associated with exposure to harmful substances and pathogens present in the biomedical waste. On the other hand, Town B's approach to waste management represents a more responsible and safer alternative. By taking their biomedical waste to an ecological site specifically designed for the disposal and treatment of hazardous waste, Town B minimizes the risk of groundwater contamination and the spread of disease. Ecological waste management sites follow strict regulations and use proper treatment methods, such as incineration, autoclaving, or chemical disinfection, to ensure that waste is effectively neutralized before disposal. This not only reduces the risk of groundwater contamination but also lessens the likelihood of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, that can result from improper waste management practices. In conclusion, by disposing of their biomedical waste in regular dump sites for 10 years, Town A has increased the likelihood of groundwater contamination and disease spread in their community. On the other hand, Town B's responsible ecological waste management practices have significantly reduced these risks, leading to better public health and a safer environment."},{"instruction":"Question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Best Subsonic client still!

Article: Scholars now believe that the Arian Party was not monolithic, but held drastically different theological views that spanned the early Christian theological spectrum. They supported the tenets of Origenist thought and theology, but had little else in common. Moreover, many labelled \\"Arian\\" did not consider themselves followers of Arius. In addition, non-Homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of Arius, since Arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops. However, others point to the Council of Nicaea as proof in and of itself that Arianism was a real theological ideology.[citation needed] Question: Did all Arians believe the same things?","output":"No, not all Arians believed in the same things. Although it is common to view the Arian Party as a monolithic entity espousing a singular set of beliefs, recent scholarship has come to challenge this perception. Instead, it is now believed that the Arian Party was a more diverse group of individuals and their theological views varied across the spectrum of early Christian thought. One common thread shared by the Arians was their support for Origenist thought and theology, which was derived from the teachings of the early Christian theologian Origen. Origenism emphasized the pre-existence of souls, the allegorical interpretation of scriptures, and a belief in the final restoration of all souls to God (apokatastasis). However, beyond these shared tenets, individual Arian beliefs diverged significantly. It is important to note that many individuals labeled as \\"Arian\\" did not explicitly identify as followers of Arius, the presbyter and theologian from Alexandria who lent his name to the movement. In fact, some non-Homoousian bishops – who rejected the concept of the Son being of the same substance as the Father – took issue with being labeled as followers of Arius. These bishops, being fully ordained, did not appreciate being compared to a mere presbyter. The Council of Nicaea, convened in 325 CE, also played a role in contributing to the misconception of Arianism as a homogenous theological ideology. Although the council aimed to resolve the controversy surrounding the nature of the relationship between the Father and the Son, it led to the development of the Nicene Creed, which reinforced the view of Arianism as a cohesive theological perspective. The resulting debate surrounding Arianism and its rejection at the Council of Nicaea may have unintentionally contributed to the simplification of the movement's beliefs. In summary, it is incorrect to assume that all Arians believed in the same things. The Arian Party was, in fact, a more diverse group with theological views that spanned a wide range of early Christian beliefs. It is essential to recognize this complexity to better understand the nuances of the theological debates and controversies that shaped the early Christian Church."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If you need to get your system clear of cocaine, stop using the drug right away. One-time users will have cocaine in their urine for at least 4-8 hours afterwards, but cocaine can still be detected for up to 4 days even after a single use. However, habitual users can show up positive on a drug test for up to a month. The sooner you stop using, the sooner you’ll be clean. ” Anyone who uses cocaine will likely have a comedown or “crash” after the initial effects of the drug wear off. This is your body rebalancing itself in terms of energy and mood. Expect to be tired and potentially depressed for a short time, even up to 2-3 days. The cocaine crash is not the same thing as withdrawal, though there are some overlapping symptoms. If you’ve been using cocaine regularly, you will probably experience symptoms of withdrawal when you remove it from your life. Tell yourself ahead of time that you will get through it, and prepare yourself mentally to experience any of the following:  Severe cravings Nausea and vomiting Paranoia, depression, or anxiety Mood swings or irritability Itching or a feeling that something is crawling on your skin Insomnia, sleeping too much, or vivid and distressing dreams Fatigue and exhaustion If you’ve been using cocaine for a long time or using it often, you may need to go through medically-supervised detoxification. There’s no drug that can remove cocaine from your system, but a medical professional can help you through withdrawal by giving you medications to counteract the withdrawal symptoms. If you need help, look online for a detox center near you.  Depending on your symptoms and how heavily you used cocaine, a detox program can last from 3 days to over a week. An inpatient rehabilitation program can last around 30 days. Outpatient detox can cost you between 1,000-1,500, whereas a full rehab program can cost up to 20,000. There’s no great way to flush your system of cocaine and its metabolites (what your body turns it into), so you may just have to wait it out. If so, know that how long cocaine takes to leave your system depends upon a number of different factors:  How much you used: More cocaine takes longer to leave. How often you use it: The more often you use, the longer it lasts in your body. What was mixed with the cocaine, i.e. how pure it was: Purer cocaine leaves more drug in your body. If you were also drinking alcohol: Alcohol slows down elimination of the drug at first, keeping it in your body longer. How well your liver and kidneys function. If you have liver or kidney problems, your body won’t clear cocaine as effectively as in a healthy person. Your weight: Cocaine sticks around longer in heavier individuals. Summary:","output":"Cocaine is a drug that makes people feel super happy and active for a while, but after that, they feel really, really tired and sad. If someone uses cocaine just one time, it can be found in their pee for 4 days. But if someone uses it a lot, it can be found in their body even after a month.  When people stop using cocaine, they can feel sick, scared, itchy, and have trouble sleeping. They might also feel like something creepy is crawling on their skin. It's because their body is trying to get used to not having any more cocaine. If people have been using cocaine a lot and for a long time, they might need to go to a special doctor who will help them feel better while their body is cleaning out the cocaine. This can take a while, from 3 days to even more than a week. Depending on how much help they need, it may cost a lot of money. There is not a quick way to clean out cocaine from someone's body. So, how long it takes for the cocaine to leave depends on how much someone used it, how often they were using it, how strong it was, if they were using it with alcohol, how well their liver and kidneys are working, and how much they weigh."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The gameplay is slow, and very very VERY choppy. I messed around with everything the best i could.. cleared my desktop.. yada yada yada and nothing helped. I'm sure it is a great game if it worked on your computer, but it probably takes up so much darn space and everything else that it is just too much for your computer and graphic/sound cards.. oh yeah my sound disappears as well. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, buy the first two.. they were GREAT! Also, I wouldnt buy any future hard truck/18 wheels of steel games.. they are just going to take more space. I'm actually quitting buying ALL computer games, cuz games now take up too much. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative. Several factors contribute to the overall negative tone. The title, \\"Bad, Bad, BAD,\\" immediately sets the tone for the rest of the review, as it emphasizes the author's dissatisfaction with the product. Furthermore, the reviewer uses strong negative words and phrases throughout the review like \\"terrible,\\" \\"slow,\\" \\"choppy\\" and \\"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\\" Apart from criticizing the graphics and gameplay, the reviewer also expresses frustration with the technical issues they experienced while trying to play the game, such as the disappearing sound and the game taking up a lot of space on their computer. This further adds to the negative tone of the review, indicating that the game is not only poorly designed, but also technically flawed. However, there is a brief positive mention in the review when the author recommends buying the first two games in the series, stating that they were \\"GREAT!\\" Nevertheless, this moment of positivity is overshadowed by the overall negative sentiment expressed in the rest of the review. Additionally, the reviewer extends their dissatisfaction to future games in the series and the entire genre of computer games, claiming that they will quit buying all computer games due to the increasing space requirements. In summary, the product review carries a strongly negative tone, as it criticizes multiple aspects of the game, highlights technical issues, expresses doubts about future products in the series, and suggests an overarching frustration with computer games in general. The positive mention of the previous games in the series does little to balance out the overwhelmingly negative tone of the review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

Movie title: Alphaville Context: Lemmy Caution is a secret agent with the code number of 003 from \\"the Outlands\\". Entering Alphaville in his Ford Mustang,[3] called a Ford Galaxie,[4] he poses as a journalist named Ivan Johnson, and claims to work for the Figaro-Pravda. He wears a tan overcoat that stores various items such as an M1911A1 Colt Commander automatic pistol. He carries a cheap Instamatic camera (new in 1965) with him and photographs everything he sees, particularly the things that would ordinarily be unimportant to a journalist. Caution is, in fact, on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon); lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun which is in complete control of all of Alphaville. Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60's dictates is that \\"people should not ask 'why', but only say 'because'.\\" People who show signs of emotion (weeping at the death of a wife, or smiling) are presumed to be acting illogically, and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed. In an image reminiscent of George Orwell's concept of Newspeak, there is a dictionary in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned. As a result, Alphaville is an inhuman, alienated society. Caution is told that men are killed at a ratio of fifty to every one woman executed.

Write an article with the title: \\"Memorial Day ceremonies honor those who serve\\"","output":"Title: Memorial Day ceremonies honor those who serve Introduction: Every year on the last Monday in May, the United States commemorates those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country. Memorial Day ceremonies across the nation honor these fallen heroes by providing an opportunity for reflection, remembrance, and expression of gratitude. These events serve as a crucial reminder that the freedom and security we enjoy today have been paid for with the lives of those who have fought valiantly to protect it. (In this introduction, I establish the context of Memorial Day and its significance to American society, as well as the role these ceremonies play in honoring the sacrifice of servicemembers.) 1. The history of Memorial Day  Memorial Day originated as \\"Decoration Day\\" in the years following the Civil War, when individuals would visit cemeteries to decorate the graves of fallen soldiers. The first large-scale commemoration occurred in 1868, and it eventually evolved into a national observance under the name Memorial Day. In 1971, it was established as an official federal holiday to be celebrated on the last Monday of May each year. By discussing the history of Memorial Day I provide a background of the holiday and how it started.  2. Honoring the fallen with ceremonies and traditions  Across the United States, communities honor the fallen through various ceremonies and traditions. These may include: - The National Moment of Remembrance: A national act of unity observed at 3 p.m. local time, during which all Americans are encouraged to pause for a minute of silence to remember the fallen and their sacrifices. This illustrates a shared tradition and moment of respect for those who have served.    - Parades: Many towns and cities host parades featuring veterans, military personnel, and local organizations. Parades allow communities to come together and publicly express their gratitude for the service and sacrifices of the fallen. - Flag Etiquette: On Memorial Day, flags are raised to full-staff in the morning and then lowered to half-staff until noon to honor the fallen. In the afternoon, they are raised once more to represent the resilience of the nation and the sacrifices made to preserve freedom. Describing these actions helps the reader to understand national rituals and customs tied to the holiday. 3. Community involvement: Volunteering and educating future generations By taking part in Memorial Day ceremonies and commemorations, communities can instill the importance of service and sacrifice in future generations. Volunteer opportunities, such as cemetery cleanups or placing flags on the graves of fallen service members, foster a sense of civic responsibility and teach valuable lessons about the cost of freedom. Additionally, engaging children in these activities ensures that the memories of those who have given their lives for their country will not be forgotten. This section highlights the role of communities in perpetuating the memory and message of Memorial Day. Conclusion: Memorial Day ceremonies hold a significant place in American society as a tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom and security. Through nationwide observances, individual acts of remembrance, and community participation, these ceremonies ensure that the brave men and women who have fought for our country are honored and remembered for generations to come. By concluding the article, I reiterate the importance of Memorial Day ceremonies and their role in honoring the fallen servicemembers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: A subclass needs to make money to cover its costs. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The statement \\"a subclass has to generate revenue to cover its costs\\" explicitly lays out the requirement that a subclass must be financially self-sufficient. In order to achieve this, the subclass must indeed generate revenue, which can be interpreted as making money. Since the premise states that this revenue generation is intended to cover the associated costs, the hypothesis, \\"a subclass needs to make money to cover its costs,\\" aligns directly with the premise. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis can be better understood if we break it down into more detail. The premise establishes the following conditions: 1. There is a subclass. 2. The subclass has costs associated with its operation or existence. 3. The subclass is required to generate revenue. 4. The purpose of this revenue generation is to cover these aforementioned costs. Given these conditions provided by the premise, the hypothesis logically follows. If a subclass is required to generate revenue in order to cover its costs, then it naturally needs to make money for that same purpose. Therefore, we can conclude that the premise does indeed entail the hypothesis. It is important to note that this entailment is based on a specific context in which the subclass must be financially self-sufficient and generate revenue to cover its costs. If the context or criteria change, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis may no longer hold true.

Information:  - The judiciary (also known as the judicial system or court system) is the system of courts that interprets and applies the law in the name of the state. The judiciary also provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes. In some nations, under doctrines of separation of powers, the judiciary generally does not make law (which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law and applies it to the facts of each case. In other nations, the judiciary can make law, known as Common Law, by setting precedent for other judges to follow, as opposed to Statutory Law made by the legislature. The Judiciary is often tasked with ensuring equal justice under law.  - The Governor of California is the chief executive of the California state government, commander-in-chief of the California National Guard and the California State Military Reserve, whose responsibilities also include making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced. The position was created in 1849, the year before California became a state. The current governor is Jerry Brown, a Democrat who was inaugurated January 3, 2011, and who had previously served as governor from 1975 to 1983. In October 2013, Jerry Brown surpassed Earl Warren for the longest cumulative period of time served as governor.  - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.  - Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy. Nearly all modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the United Kingdom is a crowned republic, Ireland is a parliamentary republic, and the United States is a federal republic.  - Baja California, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California, is a state in Mexico.

It has an area of , or 3.57% of the land mass of Mexico and comprises the northern half of the Baja California Peninsula, north of the 28th parallel, plus oceanic Guadalupe Island. The mainland portion of the state is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the east by Sonora, the U.S. State of Arizona, and the Gulf of California (also known as the \\"Sea of Cortez\\"), and on the south by Baja California Sur. Its northern limit is the U.S. state of California.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government.  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California.  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States.

The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration.  - An election is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century. Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government. This process is also used in many other private and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.  - Edmund Gerald \\"Jerry\\" Brown Jr. (born April 7, 1938) is an American politician and lawyer who has served as the 39th Governor of California since 2011.

Question: Information:  - The Kent Music Report was a weekly record chart of Australian music singles and albums which was compiled by music enthusiast David Kent from May 1974 through to 1988. After 1988, the Australian Recording Industry Association, who had been using the report under licence for a number of years, chose to produce their own charts as the 'ARIA Charts'.  - The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) is a trade group representing the Australian recording industry which was established in 1983 by six major record companies, EMI, Festival, CBS, RCA, WEA and Universal replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956. It oversees the collection, administration and distribution of music licenses and royalties.  - The ARIA Charts are the main Australian music sales charts, issued weekly by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The charts are a record of the highest selling singles and albums in various genres in Australia. ARIA became the official Australian music chart in June 1988, succeeding the Kent Music Report which had been Australia's national charts since 1974.  - \`\` Do for You '' / \`\` I Want It '' is a 1992 song recorded by the Australian act Euphoria . The track reached number seven on the ARIA Charts in 1992 and is the act 's third single after \`\` One In A Million . '' \`\` Do For You '' had a more mid-tempo dance feel , while \`\` I Want It '' had a techno / house beat , which featured rapper Young MC , who got credits on the latter .

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.

Please answer the following question: As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

Article: Short people, studies have shown , are more likely to have a stroke , suffer from high blood pressures and heart disease and be bullied in school . Now, researchers report that short people--at least in the past--were also more likely to die at a younger age than their taller peers. Their study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology   and Community Health , found that short bones have something to do with short life for more than 1,000 years. The conclusion was based on 490 sets of adult skeletal  remains from an archaeological  site in northeastern England , YC dating from the 9th century to about 1850 . About 55% of men and 73% of women died before the age of 45, and 39% of men and 56% of women died before age 30. The risk of death before age 30 declined as bone length increased. \\"This study provides evidence from an archaeological sample that long bone length is connected with age at death--those with smaller bones tend to die younger,\\" according to Dr. D.J. Gunnell of the university of Bristol  in the UK and colleagues . While it is not clear why short stature  might be linked to earlier death , the researchers point out that height is _ of childhood nutrition, which may have long-lasting effect on health . \\"Mechanism   for height-mortality  associations in the past may differ from those today , for example , short stature may have increased the risk of death in childbirth and this may explain the higher risk of premature  mortality in women,\\" Gunnell and colleagues write . \\"However, short bones, it would appear, have always been a marker of a short life,\\" the authors conclude.

Related Coverage Police: Both escaped inmates now back in custody      ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) – The second escaped prison inmate has been captured in Albuquerque.            Back in cuffs and on his way to a cell Saturday, Lionel Clah seemed to have few regrets about his run for freedom.      “It’s been ten years in prison, I wanted to get out,” Clah told reporters.      Clah later said he had fun while he was on the run and that it was all worth it.      He and Joseph Cruz escaped from a prisoner transport van headed to Las Cruces Wednesday. Officials think the men got away in the Artesia area when the van stopped for gas. Just hours later they were caught on camera at an Albuquerque hotel. That sparked a manhunt that shut down parts of the city in recent days. Many residents say they lost sleep over it.      “It’s just a little scary to know that somebody who was wanted, on the loose and stuff like that was so close. I mean, the past couple of days I’ve been kinda on edge, you know,” said Northeast Heights Resident Stacey Garcia.      Joseph Cruz had been serving a life sentence for murder. Clah got a 30 year sentence for armed robbery, and a shooting, that injured a deputy.      Cruz was caught Friday in the UNM area. Clah was still on the run until Saturday morning, when a woman living near Morris and Montgomery called police.      “She returned home after a couple nights of being away and she believed someone was inside of her apartment,�? said Albuquerque Police Department Spokesperson Officer Simon Drobik.      It was Clah.      Drobik said, “Mr. Clah literally stepped out the front door and came out and surrendered. He did state to us he didn’t want anybody else to get hurt.”      Residents say it’s a relief to hear they’re both back behind bars. Now they want answers as to how this happened in the first place.      “You kinda wonder, but who knows the circumstances, but yeah, you really wonder how that could possibly happen,�? said a Northeast Heights resident, Bud Tuttle.      “It would be good to say that yes, we’ve made changes to policies or we’re increasing our procedures or something, to help that this would not happen again,” said another nearby resident, Sarah Erb.      Investigators are still trying to figure out if anyone helped these men during their escape. They’re interviewing their family, friends and even Corrections Department employees.      Officials say the woman who lives in the apartment Clah was found at does know him but won’t say how. But they say if she willingly helped him, she will be arrested.

Simon Drobik, an officer with the department, said a woman called saying Clah was holed up in her apartment.      When officers arrived, they saw smoke coming out of a closed door and called tactical teams for backup. After about an hour, Clah came out of the apartment and surrendered, Drobik said.      Police are investigating how Clah got into the woman's apartment. He said she said she was away for two days but had \\"some sort of relationship\\" to Clah, and \\"if she has anything to do with harboring him she will be finding herself in jail with him also.\\"      \\"If someone bought this guy a sandwich or this other guy a sandwich, they will be sitting in jail with them shortly for harboring a fugitive,\\" Drobik said.      \\"These guys, they're on the run and they're unpredictable,\\" he added. \\"Thank God that this guy stepped out and surrendered to us.\\"      The other escapee, Joseph Cruz, 32, was caught Friday following a brief foot chase near the University of New Mexico campus shortly after 5:30 p.m. local time, said New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas.

Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

This simple, one ingredient treatment will add moisture to hair and make it easier to straighten. You'll need whole milk, a spray bottle, and a way to heat the milk. You start by boiling milk to release preservatives. Then, you'll cool the milk before applying to hair. By leaving this treatment on for thirty minutes once a week, you'll see significant improvement in the overall condition and manageability of your hair. If you have wavy hair, using a milk treatment may completely straighten it. For tighter curls, the milk provides a more relaxed wave, and improves the effect of other straightening methods.  Boil milk and pour into a spray bottle. Then, place the spray bottle in the refrigerator to cool. Section damp hair and spray milk evenly covering every strand, and comb through hair. Let the milk sit on hair for half an hour to 45 minutes. Then, wash and condition hair. These two ingredients are added to numerous products to improve shine, clean oil and buildup from the scalp naturally, and help hair retain moisture. A simple at-home treatment that combines the two will turn kinky, frizzy curls into sleek, manageable tresses.  Start with enough coconut milk to completely coat your hair. Overestimate to make sure you have enough. Mix the fruit of one lemon into the coconut milk. Let the mixture cool in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Starting with damp or dry hair, coat thoroughly and leave in for about an hour. Then, wash and condition as usual. Lemon juice can also lighten your hair, so this may not be an ideal treatment, if you are trying to maintain your dye color. Castor oil is a great natural treatment for a number of health and beauty concerns. From dry skin to upset stomach, castor oil does it all. It's also a simple way to relax curls. Castor oil seeps into hair follicles and naturally reduces kinks and curls, leaving hair sleeker and straighter.  Apply castor oil to damp or dry hair, and wrap hair in a towel. Use pins or clips to hold the towel in place. Leave on at least an hour, but let the product sit over night for best results. Wash and condition as usual.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Krum was the Khan of Bulgaria from sometime after 796 but before 803 until his death in 814. During his reign the Bulgarian territory doubled in size, spreading from the middle Danube to the Dnieper and from Odrin to the Tatra Mountains. His able and energetic rule brought law and order to Bulgaria and developed the rudiments of state organisation.  - Nikephoros I or Nicephorus I , also Logothetes or Genikos ( Greek :    , Nikphoros I , \`\` Bringer of Victory '' ; died July 26 , 811 ) , was Byzantine Emperor from 802 to 811 AD , when he was killed in the Battle of Pliska . A patrician from Seleucia Sidera , Nikephoros was appointed finance minister ( logothets tou genikou ) by the Empress Irene . With the help of the patricians and eunuchs he contrived to dethrone and exile Irene , and to be chosen as Emperor in her stead on October 31 , 802 . He crowned his son Staurakios co-emperor in 803 . His rule was endangered by Bardanes Tourkos , one of his ablest generals , who revolted and received support from other commanders , notably the later emperors Leo V the Armenian and Michael II the Amorian in 803 . But Nikephoros gained over the latter two , and by inducing the rebel army to disperse achieved the submission of Bardanes , who was blinded and relegated to a monastery . A conspiracy headed by the patrician Arsaber had a similar issue . Nikephoros embarked on a general reorganization of the Empire , creating new themes in the Balkans ( where he initiated the re-Hellenization by resettling Greeks from Anatolia ) and strengthening the frontiers . Needing large sums to increase his military forces , he set himself with great energy to increase the Empire 's revenue . By his rigorous tax imposts he alienated the favour of his subjects , and especially of the clergy , whom he otherwise sought to control firmly . Although he appointed an iconodule , Nikephoros as patriarch , Emperor Nikephoros was portrayed as a villain by ecclesiastical historians like Theophanes the Confessor . In 803 Nikephoros concluded a treaty , called the \`\` Pax Nicephori '' , with Charlemagne , but refused to recognize the latter 's imperial dignity . Relations deteriorated and led to a war over Venice in 806 -- 810 . In the process Nikephoros had quelled a Venetian rebellion in 807 , but suffered extensive losses to the Franks . The conflict was resolved only after Nikephoros ' death ,...  - The Battle of Pliska or Battle of Vrbitsa Pass was a series of battles between troops, gathered from all parts of the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Nicephorus I Genik, and Bulgaria, governed by Khan Krum. The Byzantines plundered and burned the Bulgar capital Pliska which gave time for the Bulgarians to block passes in the Balkan Mountains that served as exits out of Bulgaria. The final battle took place on 26 July 811, in some of the passes in the eastern part of the Balkans, most probably the Vrbitsa Pass. There, the Bulgarians used the tactics of ambush and surprise night attacks to effectively trap and immobilize the Byzantine forces, thus annihilating almost the whole army, including the Emperor. After the battle, Krum encased Nicephorus's skull in silver, and used it as a cup for wine-drinking. This is one of the best documented instances of the custom of the skull cup.  - The Balkan mountain range (Bulgarian and , Latin Serbian Stara planina, \\"Old Mountain\\"; ) is a mountain range in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula. The Balkan range runs 560 km from the Vrashka Chuka Peak on the border between Bulgaria and Serbia eastward through central Bulgaria to Cape Emine on the Black Sea. The highest peaks of the Balkan Mountains are in central Bulgaria. The highest peak is Botev at 2,376 m, which makes the mountain range the third highest in the country, after Rila and Pirin. The mountains are the source of the name of the Balkan Peninsula.   - Pliska (, romanized: \\"Plskov\\") is the name of both the first capital of the First Bulgarian Empire and a small town situated 20 km Northeast of the provincial capital Shumen.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\".  - The First Bulgarian Empire (Old ) was a medieval Bulgarian state that existed in southeastern Europe between the 7th and 11th centuries AD. It was founded circa 681 when Bulgar tribes led by Asparukh moved to the northeastern Balkans. There they secured Byzantine recognition of their right to settle south of the Danube by defeating  possibly with the help of local South Slavic tribes  the Byzantine army led by Constantine IV. At the height of its power, Bulgaria spread from the Danube Bend to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River to the Adriatic Sea.    What is the relationship between 'nikephoros i' and '26 july 811'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between Nikephoros I and 26 July 811 is that on this date, Nikephoros I, the Byzantine Emperor, was killed in the Battle of Pliska. The battle was fought between the Byzantine Empire, led by Nikephoros I, and Bulgaria, governed by Khan Krum. The Bulgarians used ambush and surprise night attack tactics, effectively trapping and immobilizing the Byzantine forces, leading to the annihilation of almost the entire Byzantine army, including the death of Emperor Nikephoros I."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mike wanted to buy both a truck or a convertible, but the","output":"dealership didn't have the specific models he had been eyeing for months. After much research and deliberation, Mike had narrowed down his choices to either a reliable pickup truck that would allow him to haul heavy loads and go off-roading, or a stylish convertible that would let him bask in the sun and feel the wind in his hair as he cruised the open road. The dilemma now was to find a dealership that carried both vehicles so he could see which one felt right. One morning, as Mike sipped his coffee and scrolled through his phone, he came across an ad for a dealership an hour away in a neighboring town. The ad showcased the exact truck and convertible models he had been looking for. Excited, Mike decided to make a trip to the dealership that weekend to see these vehicles in person. Mike arrived at the dealership bright and early on Saturday. The sun was shining and there was a slight crispness in the air, almost as if it was encouraging him to choose the convertible. Eager to get started, Mike looked around for a salesman who could assist him.  A friendly face approached him – it was Dan, a veteran car salesman who had been working in the industry for over two decades. Dan shook Mike's hand firmly and listened intently as Mike described his dilemma between the truck and the convertible. Dan, with his years of experience, knew what Mike was going through. The decision between two completely different vehicles could be tough, especially when both could bring joy and utility in their own way. Dan decided that it would be best if he let Mike experience both vehicles firsthand. First, they took the truck for a spin. Mike loved the commanding view of the road and the power of the engine as they accelerated. The truck's suspension made bumpy roads feel smooth, and Mike could already envision himself driving this truck on remote trails and hauling materials for his weekend home improvement projects.  Next, they switched to the convertible. Upon getting in the driver's seat, Mike's face lit up as the roof disappeared into the trunk of the car with the push of a button. The driving experience with this car was completely different. He reveled in the sun kissing his face and the wind rushing through his hair as they cruised down winding roads, feeling free and alive. The world felt like his to explore, and he couldn't help but smile with every turn and acceleration. After their test drives, Mike and Dan sat down, and Mike shared his thoughts. Just as he was beginning to lean towards one vehicle, memories of the other would come flooding back and create confusion. Dan decided to share a bit of advice to help Mike make a decision. \\"Mike,\\" he began, \\"It's clear that you're torn between these two options. What's important to remember is that you need to prioritize your needs and desires. Think of your daily lifestyle and what would benefit you most. Consider not only the fun factor of each vehicle but also the practicality. And remember, life is too short to make decisions that don't bring you happiness.\\" As Mike took the evening to ponder his decision, he reflected on not only his current lifestyle but also what future endeavors he wished to pursue. He thought about the roads he had yet to explore and the possibilities that laid before him. Finally, Mike made up his mind. He was going to choose the convertible because he loved the feeling of freedom it provided and felt it fit better with his free-spirited nature. Although the truck may have been helpful for some aspects in his life, he believed prioritizing happiness was essential. He took Dan's advice to heart, and the following day, he returned to the dealership to begin the purchasing process. Looking back, Mike never regretted his choice. The convertible became synonymous with endless adventures, enjoyable road trips with family and friends, and a newfound happiness that emerged every time he went for a drive. While there were moments when a truck would have been useful, Mike always found alternatives, proving that he had ultimately made the choice that was right for him. The decision may have been challenging, but taking the time to consider his needs and desires ultimately led him to the vehicle that brought the most joy and fulfillment to his life for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Nicaragua warns Costa Rica it may try to 'reclaim' province in court      (AFP) – Sep 2, 2013      MANAGUA — President Daniel Ortega warned Costa Rica that Nicaragua may ask the International Court of Justice to restore to Managua a province he said it lost to \\"occupation\\" in 1824.      Ortega was referring to Guanacaste province, which is about 20 percent of neighboring Costa Rica's territory and a popular tourism hub.      \\"Costa Rica did not win that territory in an international court, but rather by force, with arms,\\" Ortega said at a military ceremony on Monday.      He said he would like to negotiate with San Jose over the issue, an idea that has been rejected by Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla.      Copyright © 2013 AFP. All rights reserved. More » ||||| Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla led a march protesting Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega’s bid to claim a tourist-rich province belonging to its southern neighbor.      Chinchilla was joined by legislators, Cabinet members and protesters today in a “march for the homeland” that began in the town of Nicoya in the northwest province of Guanacaste. The province, home to some of Costa Rica’s most-visited beaches and hotels owned by Four Seasons Holdings Inc. and Hilton Worldwide Inc., is the country’s least populated and second-largest region, about the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined.      Tensions between the Central American neighbors were heightened last week when Ortega said he may file a case with the International Court of Justice to “recover” Guanacaste, which he claimed was Nicaraguan territory. Guanacaste was annexed to form part of Costa Rica in 1824, about three years after Central America’s independence from Spain. The anniversary of the annexation is a Costa Rican holiday celebrated on July 25.      “We aren’t talking about a a tiny territory, we are talking about hundreds of kilometers,” Ortega said in an Aug. 13 speech. “This is something yet to be debated, and we should consider bringing a case to the International Court of Justice.”      ‘Provocations’      Chinchilla, who is in the final year of her presidency, said Ortega’s threat ignored history and disrupted the “beautiful friendship” between Costa Ricans and Nicaraguans. Newspaper La Nacion said “hundreds” of people took part in the march.      “President Ortega, we will not let your irresponsibility separate our countries,” Chinchilla, 54, said in a speech after the march. “We will not fall for your provocations, but we will also not be passive toward them.”      Costa Rica and Nicaragua have a history of border and territorial disputes. The ICJ ruled in 2011 that Nicaraguan soldiers had to evacuate a swath of land south of the San Juan River, which serves as the countries’ international border.      Nicaragua signed a treaty ceding Guanacaste to Costa Rica in 1858 shortly after the country had been under the temporary military rule of U.S. adventurer William Walker.      “It wasn’t a treaty signed voluntarily and Costa Rica knows that,” said Carlos Arguello, Nicaragua’s representative to the ICJ, in a statement on the presidential website. “What is going to be done or can be done about it is up to the president.”      40 Billion Canal      Ortega’s latest comments are meant to divert attention from Nicaragua’s 40 billion plan to build an inter-oceanic canal, according to Constantino Urcuyo, a political analyst at Ciapa, a policy research institute in San Jose, Costa Rica. Legislation granting a concession to build the canal was passed earlier this year by the Nicaraguan Congress, generating protests from opposition and environmental groups.      “Ortega has had a lot of opposition to the canal project and to calm it he looked for an easy target,” Urcuyo said in a phone interview from San Jose. “Every time Ortega needs to earn national support, he resorts to his traditional enemy.”      Costa Rica’s consulate in Managua, Nicaragua’s capital, has been closed since Aug. 18, when protesters blocked its entrance, Ambassador Javier Sancho said in a phone interview.      “Some anti-Costa Rican sentiment has increased in recent days,” Sancho said. “Hopefully things will get back to normal shortly to the benefit of both the Costa Rican and Nicaraguan people.”      To contact the reporter on this story: Adam Williams in San Jose, Costa Rica at awilliams111@bloomberg.net      To contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net; Andre Soliani at asoliani@bloomberg.net ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In September 2013, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega warned Costa Rica that Nicaragua may ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to restore Guanacaste province to Managua, which it claimed was lost due to \\"occupation\\" in 1824.

Years of being kept in my purse means it's outside has worn down quite a bit - the paint is rubbing off - but i think it's a badge of honor for a pen. Refills are easy to get.

As I viewed the artwork to,\\"King of the Ants\\" I instantly thought HORROR! The arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover & back spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal, & retribution. Instead what I discovered beneath that surface, was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock. \\"King of the Ants\\" features Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Except Sean Crawley is someone you don't care about, never once did I feel any compassion or sympathy for this character. In fact he's downright unlikable, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews)who turns in an uninspired performance as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to recite. Throw in Kari Wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust (esp. in the homeless), and little to no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, which is basically a sober Norm from Cheers but MEAN! Now there are a couple of interesting \\"hallucination\\" sequences in this film (the source of the cover images) but this film never delves further into that world.

The author begins by expressing disappointment in the difference between their expectations based on the book's cover and the actual content, describing it as \\"less interesting than what you can find under your average rock.\\" Throughout the review, there is a continued focus on the flaws of the story and its characters. The author criticizes the protagonist, Sean Crawley, as unlikable, and the reader is told that they never felt any compassion or sympathy for him.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To address this task, I will need to break down the premise and the hypothesis, compare them, and draw a conclusion based on the logical implications. Step 1: Understand the premise The premise seems to refer to the process of learning about the unique attributes of various regions within a specific state by reading about it. It suggests that reading is a valid method to get information about these areas. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that the only way to learn about the unique attributes of a state is by reading. This suggests that reading is the solitary means of acquiring this information. Step 3: Compare premise and hypothesis The premise and the hypothesis both mention reading as a method of learning about the state's different areas. However, they diverge in a significant way. The premise suggests reading as a method, but it does not state that it's the exclusive way to learn. Conversely, the hypothesis claims that reading is the only way to gather information about the state’s regions. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Given the differences identified, it's impossible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise doesn't limit the methods of learning strictly to reading, while the hypothesis does. Therefore, even if the premise is true, and reading can indeed provide information about different regions within a state, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is also true, as there might be other ways to learn about such information not mentioned in the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: \\"At what age should a man be concerned about being a 'creepy old man', rather than just a guy who’s dating?\\" Second question: What do you talk to women about in bars? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing, but they are related as they both pertain to interacting with or dating other individuals. I will address each question in detail below. First question: \\"At what age should a man be concerned about being a 'creepy old man', rather than just a guy who’s dating?\\" There isn't a specific age at which a man should be concerned about being perceived as a \\"creepy old man.\\" Age is just a number, and it is the way people behave and treat others that determines how they are perceived by others. In general, \\"creepy\\" behavior is characterized by being overly intrusive, making others feel uncomfortable, or pursuing individuals in an inappropriate manner. To avoid being perceived as a \\"creepy old man\\" regardless of age, it is important to follow some general guidelines: 1. Be respectful of boundaries: This includes understanding and respecting both physical and emotional boundaries of the person you are trying to establish a relationship with. 2. Act your age: It is essential to embrace life experiences and maturity while interacting with people. Trying to act much younger than your actual age can come across as disingenuous and may make others feel uncomfortable. 3. Be genuine: Do not use manipulative tactics or play games while trying to establish a connection with someone. People appreciate authenticity and honesty. 4. Be aware of the age difference: When dating someone considerably younger, take into consideration the potential difference in life stages and what that might mean for the relationship to be mutually beneficial and respectful. Second question: \\"What do you talk to women about in bars?\\" When it comes to talking to women in bars, the most effective approach is to initiate a conversation that feels natural and relaxed. Here are some suggestions for topics to engage in: 1. Small talk: Start with small talk, such as discussing the location, music, or drinks. This helps break the ice and sets a friendly tone for the conversation. 2. Hobbies and interests: Ask about her interests and hobbies, and share some of yours. This helps to assess common grounds and could potentially serve as a foundation to connect on a deeper level. 3. Compliments: Genuine compliments are often appreciated, but be sure to avoid making any comments that could be perceived as offensive or superficial. 4. Current events or pop culture: Discussing recent events or popular culture topics can help demonstrate that you're a well-informed individual and can provide material for a lighthearted conversation. 5. Personal experiences: Share stories or interesting personal experiences, as they can provide a glimpse into your character and help spark a more intimate connection. It is important to remember that every person is different, and some individuals may not be open to engaging in conversation at a bar. Always pay close attention to body language and verbal cues, and respect personal boundaries. If someone seems uninterested in talking, it is essential to recognize that signal and not push the issue further. In conclusion, both questions touch upon the interaction and dating aspect, but they are fundamentally different questions. The first focuses on how to avoid being labeled as a \\"creepy old man,\\" while the second question deals with initiating and maintaining conversation with women in social settings such as bars. By reviewing and implementing these guidelines, one can improve their social skills and understanding of how to interact respectfully with others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I've tried to sit through 'Sky Captain..\\" about 6 times, and every time, within about 3 minutes, I start doing something else - anything else! It's a downright boring movie, the acting is terrible, the writing dull, and obviously a first-time director, because it's stiff. And I wanted to love it. I love sci-fi, the old cliffhangers, and I can appreciate the attempt at nods to Flash Gordon, and Metropolis, but my God, what a waste of money. I used to work for Paramount Pictures, and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests. She told me they'd never have an interest or need to do it. 10 years later, Paramount releases this piece of crap. Sherry was right in 1993, but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog. Blue screen an effect shot, but not an entire movie. Let's not forget, neither Jude nor Jolie are terrific actors (but easy on the eyes). Paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort. Too bad - it could've worked, but only under a skilled director. the funny thing is, Sky Captain's director will keep getting work, even after this dreck.

Test sentence: \\"The twins might have both been at the party.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?   *unacceptable;  *acceptable;","output":"The test sentence, \\"The twins might have both been at the party,\\" is indeed an acceptable and grammatically correct English sentence. In this analysis, I will break down the elements of the sentence to provide a detailed explanation of why it is correct. Firstly, let's identify the main parts of the sentence: 1. Subject: The twins 2. Auxiliary Verbs: might have 3. Main Verb: been 4. Adverb: both 5. Prepositional Phrase: at the party Now, let's analyze these components in further detail. 1. Subject: \\"The twins\\" is the subject of the sentence, serving as the main focus of the statement. The noun \\"twins\\" is plural, which allows for the use of \\"both\\" later in the sentence when referring to the two individuals. The article \\"the\\" is correctly used as a specifier, indicating that we are talking about particular twins (probably mentioned earlier in a conversation or context). 2. Auxiliary Verbs: \\"Might have\\" is a combination of the modal auxiliary verb \\"might\\" and the auxiliary verb \\"have.\\" The modal verb \\"might\\" is used to express possibility or uncertainty, whereas \\"have\\" is used for perfect verb tenses. In this sentence, \\"might have\\" correctly precedes the past participle \\"been\\" to form the modal perfect verb tense, which describes an uncertain or possible event in the past. 3. Main Verb: \\"Been\\" is the past participle form of the verb \\"to be.\\" It is appropriately paired with the auxiliary verbs \\"might have\\" to create the modal perfect verb tense. This structure properly conveys the sense of uncertainty, probability, or possibility regarding the presence of the twins at the party. 4. Adverb: \\"Both\\" is an adverb, used to emphasize that the action or state applies to each of the two subjects mentioned (i.e., the twins). The placement of \\"both\\" between the auxiliary verbs and the main verb is correct, as it effectively modifies the verb \\"been.\\" 5. Prepositional Phrase: \\"At the party\\" is a prepositional phrase that provides details about where the possible action occurred. The preposition \\"at\\" is followed by the noun phrase \\"the party,\\" which serves as the object of the preposition. Thus, the test sentence \\"The twins might have both been at the party\\" correctly follows the rules of English grammar, forming a coherent and meaningful statement that expresses the possibility that both twins were present at the party. As a result, the sentence is both detailed and acceptable in terms of its grammatical construction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: The Snow Queen Context: Ellie and her brother Tom listen to their grandmother reading them a story about the evil Snow Queen. When their younger sister Polly asks Tom if the Queen is coming to their house, Tom says that she only exists in the story. However, the Snow Queen really does live in an icy palace in the North Pole with her three troll servants: Eric, Baggy, and Wardrobe. Her plan is to set up her huge magic mirror on a mountain to reflect the sunlight away so the entire world will become her kingdom. But the mirror falls down the mountain and lands on the trolls' flying machine where it shatters into pieces. Two of the pieces hit Tom in the eye and the heart that he falls into an evil curse. The Snow Queen sends her bats to retrieve the pieces. As they cannot take the two that are inside Tom, the Queen goes out to kidnap him. Ellie and Tom connect their sleds to a bigger sled that is revealed to be driven by the Snow Queen. She takes Tom to her palace and cuts Ellie off of her sled, causing her to fall onto a talking bird named Peeps. Ellie goes out to save Tom from her and Peeps reluctantly decides to go with her. In a snowy forest, they find a house belonging to an old woman, who appears nice, but is actually an evil witch but traps them to use Ellie's heart for her elixir of life so she can be eternally young. Peeps tricks the witch's cat, Cuddles, into chasing after him and knocking over the elixir of life, and uses the confusion to unlocks Ellie's cell. Ellie and Peeps escape and trap the witch in the basement. They then meet two humanoid birds named Les and Ivy, who, from Ellie's description of Tom, tell her that Tom is going to marry the princess, so Ellie becomes a member of the staff to serve the princess her food.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the original name of the person whose early work was published primarily in magazines? , can you please find it?   André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known.  They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period.

The more authentic... the better.  Hole-in-the-wall?  Great!   Nobody speaks a lick of English?  Perfect!  C grade from the health dept?  As long as the food tastes good and I don't get sick!  So when some of my Mexican friends invited me to dinner at Los Molcajetes on Eastern, I figured I would feast as if I was south of the border.    When I walked in, I thought the ambience was decent.  Servers were friendly and the chips & salsa were really good.  I ordered a Corona and was disappointed that the beer wasn't that cold.  My friends ordered what they called Mexican Cola, which is basically Coke bottled in glass bottles in Mexico.    They had several TV's on Hispanic channels that were blaring so loud we could hardly talk.    We ordered an appetizer dish of mini tacos that were covered in shredded lettuce, sliced avocados, and piled high with Mexican cheese.  This was delicious!!!  I told the server that I wanted to order the dish that they were famous for and she recommended the Molcajetes, which I later learned was basically the bowl that it was served in.  For 7 it was a bargain.  The actual meal was okay.  A bowl that was filled with everything but the kitchen sink.  Beef, chicken, shrimp, grilled green onions, avocado, tomatoes... all drenched in a spicy sauce.  It was okay.  Perhaps more suitable for sharing because it was huge.  For 17, not bad considering it would've fed 2+.    During our meal, some guy started walking around with a stack of bootleg dvd's selling them for 5 each.  Odd.  Haha.    As we finished our meal, a mariachi band asked each table if they wanted a song.  If you pay them, they stand around your table playing music so loud that you can't even hear yourself think.    I felt that the restaurant was a real miss.  Nothing was special except for what they do for birthday celebrations.  They bring out a sombrero and put it on the birthday customer and sing to them.  They have a tambourine going and clap really loud.  At the end of the song, the guys in the kitchen scream and blow on that loud, obnoxious vuvuzela horn that they blow at soccer games.

Chips and salsa are good, 6. Appetizer dish of mini tacos is delicious, 7. The famous Molcajetes dish is recommended and is a bargain, 8.

The positive sentiments primarily revolve around the food, whereas the negative sentiments focus on various off-putting aspects of the restaurant atmosphere and specific situations. However, the closing statement, \\"I won't be back,\\" suggests that the negative aspects of the experience outweighed the positive aspects for the reviewer. Additionally, the reviewer encourages others to try the restaurant themselves, implying that their experience may not be representative of the typical experience at Los Molcajetes.

As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The people who built Stonehenge in Southern England thousands of years ago had wild parties, eating barbecued pigs and breaking pottery. This is according to recent work by archaeologists--history experts who investigate how human beings lived in the past. Archaeologists digging near Stonehenge last year discovered the remains of a large prehistoric village where they think the builders of the mysterious stone circle used to live. The village is about 4,600 years old, the same age as Stonehenge and as old as the Pyramids in Egypt. It is less than two miles from the famous ancient landmark and lies inside a massive man-made circular dirt wall, or \\"henge\\", known as the Durrington Walls. Remains found at the site included jewellry, stone arrowheads, tools made of deer antlers, wooden spears and huge amounts of animal bones and broken pottery. \\"These finds suggest Stone Age people went to the village at special times of the year to feast and party\\", says Mike Parker-Pearson from Sheffield University in England. He said many of the pig bones they found had been thrown away half-eaten. He also said the partygoers appeared to have shot some of the farm pigs with arrows, possibly as a kind of sport before barbecuing them. An ancient road which led from the village to the River Avon was also found. Here, the experts think, people came after their parties to throw dead  s in the water so the bodies would be washed downstream to Stonehenge. Parker-Pearson believes Stonehenge was like a cemetery where ancient Britons buried the dead and remembered their ancestors. The theory is that Stonehenge is a kind of spirit home to the ancestors. The recent discovery of the village within the Durrington Walls shows that Stonehenge didn't stand alone but was part of a much bigger religious site, according to Parker-Pearson.People still come to worship and celebrate at Stonehenge today.

Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish authorities have brought the chief suspect in the murder of an American woman slain in Turkey to Istanbul after he was apprehended at a border crossing between Turkey and Syria on Sunday. The man suspected of killing Sarai Sierra, an American tourist who went missing on January 22, was caught in the border province of Hatay, according to a statement by the Hatay governorate. The suspect, called \\"Z.T.\\" and also known as \\"Laz Ziya,\\" was caught \\"in the Reyhanli District of our province by security forces,\\" the statement said. Sierra, a mother and amateur photographer from Staten Island, New York, was found slain by a blow to the head on February 2 near the old city walls of Istanbul.

If \\"Man on the beach is throwing a red ball.\\", does it logically follow that \\"man on the beach is playing\\"?","output":"It is not possible to conclusively determine that the man on the beach is playing based solely on the information provided in the statement, \\"Man on the beach is throwing a red ball.\\" There could be various reasons and intentions behind the man throwing a red ball; it may or may not involve play. We will explore some of the possible scenarios below. 1. Playing: One possibility is that the man is indeed playing, perhaps engaged in a game with friends or family members, like catch or dodgeball. Tossing a ball back and forth is a common form of enjoyment and physical activity at the beach. 2. Exercising or Practicing Sports: The man may not be playing, but rather engaging in physical exercise or practicing for a particular sport that involves throwing a ball. For example, he could be a baseball or American football player working on his throwing technique or strength. In this context, the act of throwing a ball would serve a specific purpose and may not be considered \\"playing.\\" 3. Training a Pet: The man could be at the beach with his dog, throwing the red ball for the dog to fetch. In this scenario, the primary focus would be on the dog's activity, while the man is simply facilitating his pet's play and exercise. 4. Occupational or Therapeutic Reason: The man could be involved in a task related to his occupation or a therapeutic exercise, such as a physical therapy session. For instance, he might be a lifeguard practicing throwing a rescue buoy, or perhaps a patient recovering from an arm or shoulder injury and following a prescribed exercise regimen that includes throwing a ball. 5. Random or Meaningless Action: It's even possible that the man's action has no particular goal or purpose, or is simply a spontaneous one-time gesture, such as casually tossing a red ball found lying on the beach. In this case, it would not be accurate to describe the man as \\"playing.\\" Thus, while it may be tempting to assume that the man is playing, it would be an oversimplification to draw this conclusion solely from the given information.

You can hide the tutorial within a story about the player character getting training (aka Fable), or you can simply display instructions (aka Mass Effect). You can even try to hide the tutorial altogether blending it seamlessly into the game or display all of the tutorial all at once. No matter what you do, make sure that it feels natural within your game. The world is the environments in which your player will play the game. How expansive will your world be? How challenging? How will you indicate that an area should be explored? That it shouldn't? These are things you'll need to consider. These are the internal rules of the game. You'll want to decide on a rule system and make sure that it's balanced and consistent. The best way to do this is to look at what other games do right or wrong in this area. The levels are the individual chunks of the game, the \\"episodes\\" that the player has to get through to make it to the end of the game. The levels should be engaging and just the right amount of challenging. They should also be physically laid out in a way that makes sense. You'll need to design all the content, like the items that can be interacted with, the characters themselves, the environmental items, etc. This can be extremely time consuming so plan ahead!

This can protect your hands from being bitten by live bed bugs and the gloves will prevent you from coming into contact with blood from smashed bed bugs. If you don't have any gloves around, wrap a plastic bag over your hand before looking for the bed bugs. Adult bed bugs are around 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) long and they have 6 legs. A bed bug that's recently fed on blood will be bright red and round. Once it digests the blood, it will turn a darker brown color and become flat. If the bed bug hasn't fed in a while, it will be a pale brown color. Since bed bugs feed on blood, they can leave behind red or rusty stains if they get smashed. The color may be bright red if the bed bug was recently crushed or the stain may be dark if the bed bug was smashed a while ago. The stains might look like single drops of blood or there will be smears and streaks. Bed bug excrement will look like very small black spots (about this size: •). The excrement can stain the fabric that's underneath it, so you may see dark streaks as well. You should also look for small pale white eggs that are around 1 millimetre (0.10 cm) in size. You may also see pale skins that the bed bug nymphs shed as they grow larger.

It soon becomes clear that Francesca cannot leave that night as a blizzard has made the roads impassable. Francesca is forced to stay in the Kinsolving mansion for a few days. She soon begins to suspect that something is amiss due to inconsistencies in information between what her late husband (Matthew) told her and Mrs. Kinsolving's statements to her.While Matthew never mentioned he had a sister, Mrs. Kinsolving claims that the mentally challenged and non-verbal Kathleen (Sian Barbara Allen) is Matthew's sister. After Mrs. Kinsolving retires for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family Bible that Matthew's mother (Maria) died eleven days after Matthew was killed in the Vietnam War, that Mrs. Kinsolving is actually Maria's sister in law, Katherine, who is Kathleen's mother and the mother of Kenny (Richard Thomas), a serial rapist and murderer who is hiding somewhere in the Kinsolving mansion. Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands the baby over to Kathleen to bury.That night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby (who is actually very much alive) in a picnic basket. Mrs. Kinsolving, suspecting Francesca is sneaking around the mansion, locks her in her room. Kathleen is able to locate the key to the room and unlocks it, allowing Francesca to care for her baby.

To sterilize your pruning equipment, simply follow these steps: - Fill a container with a solution of 10% bleach and 90% water. - Soak your pruning equipment for at least 30 seconds in the solution. - Remove the equipment and allow it to air-dry before use. Step 2: Identify and Remove Unhealthy Plant Parts When pruning perennials, it's essential to start by identifying and removing any unhealthy parts of the plant. This includes any dead, diseased, or damaged growth. Removing these parts encourages healthy new growth while eliminating potential sources of disease or pest infestations. To trim unhealthy parts of your plants, follow these general guidelines: - Cut away dead or yellowing leaves and stems. - Remove any growth that appears diseased or infested with pests. - Cut back any damaged stems or leaves which may have been caused by environmental stress or physical damage. Step 3: Prune for Shape and Size Once you have removed any unhealthy plant parts, it's time to focus on shaping your perennials. Properly shaping perennials promotes growth and improves the plant's overall appearance.  Here are some general tips for pruning perennials for shape: - Determine the desired height and shape of the plant. - Begin by removing any crowded or crossing stems to promote airflow and reduce the risk of disease. - Prune back older growth to stimulate new growth and keep the plant looking vibrant. - Trim plants to achieve the desired shape, taking care to make clean cuts at an angle to promote healthy healing. Step 4: Water After Pruning Lastly, it's essential to water your perennials after pruning. This helps the plants recover from the stress of pruning, as well as promoting the growth of new stems and leaves. When watering your plants, avoid overhead watering which could potentially lead to the development of fungal diseases on the newly exposed cut surfaces. Instead, water at the base of the plant, making sure the soil is evenly moist but not overly saturated. Conclusion: Pruning is an essential component of maintaining healthy and vibrant perennials in your garden. By following the steps outlined in this guide, including sterilizing pruning equipment, trimming away unhealthy plant parts, shaping your perennials, and watering them after pruning, you'll be well on your way to a beautiful and thriving garden of lush, flourishing perennials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Clubbers to The Warehouse were primarily black and gay, who came to dance to music played by the club's resident DJ Frankie Knuckles, whom fans refer to as the \\"godfather of house\\". After the Warehouse closed in 1983, the crowds went to Knuckles' new club, The Power Plant. In the Channel 4 documentary Pump Up The Volume, Knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term \\"house music\\" was upon seeing \\"we play house music\\" on a sign in the window of a bar on Chicago's South Side. One of the people in the car with him joked, \\"you know, that's the kind of music you play down at the Warehouse!\\", and then everybody laughed. South-Side Chicago DJ Leonard \\"Remix\\" Roy, in self-published statements, claims he put such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one's home; in his case, it referred to his mother's soul & disco records, which he worked into his sets.

The well-crafted jokes, impeccable comic timing, and the natural chemistry between the comedians on stage captivated us from the beginning, leaving us in stitches and gasping for breath due to the continuous laughter. The comedians managed to create an atmosphere of merriment, where we could forget our daily stresses and simply bask in the joy of shared laughter, which is a highly therapeutic and bonding experience. As the comedy show progressed, we discovered the intricacies of the comedic sketches, the satirical satire of current events and culture, and the self-deprecating wit that provided an intelligent, yet lighthearted entertainment. The comedians effortlessly connected with the audience, establishing a sense of camaraderie that made everyone feel included and part of the experience. This intimate connection was absent in the play we had seen earlier, which contributed to our preference for the comedy show. In contrast, the play that we attended, despite being a well-executed production with a talented cast and crew, failed to fully engage us in the same manner that the comedy show managed to do. The storyline, although intriguing, did not elicit the same level of emotional investment from us. Moreover, the feeling of being mere passive observers, rather than actively participating members of the audience, made for a less captivating experience overall. Additionally, the format of the play, being a more structured and formal type of entertainment, could not provide the same level of spontaneity and fun that the comedy show did. The comedy show encouraged playful heckling, allowing for unexpected interactions that added to the overall enjoyment. This gave the comedy show a certain dynamism and unpredictable quality that kept the audience on their toes and more engaged. In comparison, the play remained rigidly confined to its established script, offering little opportunity for surprises or audience connection. In conclusion, our preference for the comedy show over the play can be attributed to a number of factors, including the immersive nature of comedic performances, the ability to establish a strong connection with the audience, and the unpredictable and spontaneous aspect that kept the audience engaged and entertained throughout the entire show. The play, while undoubtedly a form of art that holds great value, simply did not offer the same level of entertainment and enjoyment in that specific instance, leading to our lasting fondness for the comedy show experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The new administration had already begun exploring possible diplomatic options, retracing many of the paths traveled by its predecessors.U.S. envoys again pressed the Taliban to turn  Bin Laden \\"over to a country where he could face justice\\" and repeated, yet again, the warning that the Taliban would be held responsible for any al Qaeda attacks on U.S. interests.

They argued that the program needed to have a big part for Pashtun opponents of theTaliban. They also thought the program should be conducted on a larger scale than had been suggested. Clarke concurred with the idea of a larger program, but he warned that delay risked the Northern Alliance's final defeat at the hands of the Taliban.

Passage: The first years of the 14th century were marked by famines, culminating in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn. These troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe during the following three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, about one-third of the population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages. Output:","output":"Before writing the questions, let's break down the passage: 1. The passage starts with discussing the Great Famine of 1315–17 which was caused by climate change and its effects on agriculture. 2. The passage then moves on to describe the Black Death, a pandemic that killed about one-third of Europe's population in 1347. 3. The consequences of the Black Death are mentioned: increased wages due to scarcity of workers, lower demand for food, popular uprisings, and an increase in piety. 4.

You can say something like, \\"I understand that you need help with this project, but given my current workload, I cannot take on any additional responsibilities.\\" 3. Offer an alternative: Sometimes, proposing another solution or suggesting a different person for the task may soften the blow of a rejection. For example: \\"Unfortunately, I can't assist you this time, but I can recommend someone else who might be able to help you.\\" 4. Be direct yet tactful: It's crucial to be straightforward in communicating your decline, avoiding ambiguous statements that might give the asker false hope. However, using tactful language can help the person understand your decision. For example: \\"I cannot take up this offer now, as it isn't aligned with my current priorities. I hope you understand.\\" 5. Show empathy: Acknowledge the feelings of the person making the request and express empathy for their situation. This helps them see that you understand their point of view and are not dismissing their needs. For example: \\"I know how much this means to you, and I wish I could help, but I'm unable to commit to this right now.\\" 6. Express gratitude: Thank the person for thinking of you or offering the opportunity. Showing gratitude can help soften the rejection and demonstrate a positive attitude. For example: \\"Thank you for considering me, but I won't be able to participate this time.\\" 7. Use appropriate body language: Non-verbal cues play a significant role in communication. Maintain eye contact, keep a relaxed posture, and avoid crossing your arms. This way, you convey an open and honest demeanor, making the rejection seem less hostile. 8. Stand firm in your decision: Be confident in your decision and avoid backtracking, as this may create confusion. You might need to reiterate your stance politely if the person is persistent. For example: \\"I understand your position, but my decision remains the same. I cannot take part in this.\\" In summary, the best way to say \\"NO\\" is by being honest, respectful, assertive, and empathetic while offering alternatives and showing gratitude. Use appropriate body language and maintain a confident but polite demeanor to communicate your decision effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, it seems like the user is requesting the addition of a video call feature to the app. The user's review does not provide any other positive or negative feedback about the app. They simply provide a suggestion for an added feature, which implies that they might have found the app useful to some extent, but the lack of a video call function could be a limiting factor for them. Taking both the user's suggestion and the absence of clear positive feedback into account, I would recommend \\"Maybe\\" to a friend if they were looking for an app with the video call feature already built-in. It is important to consider the user's main concern and focus on that aspect while evaluating the app. However, it would also be valuable to explore the app further to familiarize oneself with its available features and performance. Since the given review does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the app's pros and cons, a personal assessment would be necessary before making a recommendation. Moreover, the friend's requirements, preferences, and the presence (or lack) of alternative options would also be influential factors in the final decision. In conclusion, the limited information from the review makes it difficult to provide a definitive stance on recommending the app to a friend. The best course of action is to suggest a \\"Maybe\\" while encouraging further exploration of the app and considering individual preferences and needs. Additionally, the developers may take the user's feedback into account and introduce the requested video call feature in a future update, which would potentially make the app more appealing and increase the likelihood of a recommendation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Because of this, Yemen's capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden, on the southern coast. Yemen's territory includes more than 200 islands; the largest of these is Socotra.  - A region is arid when it is characterized by a severe lack of available water, to the extent of hindering or preventing the growth and development of plant and animal life. Environments subject to arid climates tend to lack vegetation and are called xeric or desertic. Most \\"arid\\" climates surround the equator; these places include most of Africa and parts of South America, Central America and Australia.  - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia.

The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.  - Arabia Deserta ( \`\` Abandoned / deserted Arabia '' , also known as Arabia Magna ( \`\` Greater Arabia '' ) in Latin signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula .

Perhaps he played up the road at the Royal Nairobi Golf Club, the oldest of the city's six golf establishments, someone suggests.

This can be seen by observing how different global events and milestones have impacted the way various countries and individuals view the United States. One significant influence on the global perception of America was the end of the Cold War. This ushered in a new era of globalization, with America emerging as a unipolar power in a post-Soviet landscape. As the United States embraced international trade and its economy boomed, many people around the world began to view America as a land of opportunity and a global leader. The election of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States further shaped international views of America. Obama, who had a Kenyan father and served as the first African-American president of the United States, represented a break from the country's predominantly white political leadership. This development was met with enthusiasm and hope in many parts of the world, especially in Africa, where numerous people saw it as a sign of progressive change and a testament to the possibility of equal opportunities for people of diverse backgrounds. However, the perception of America was not always positive over the years. The United States' foreign policy, particularly its involvement in the Middle East and other parts of the world, has been a cause of resentment and anti-American sentiment in certain regions. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the use of drone strikes, have attracted criticism and contributed to negative views of the United States among some global citizens. Additionally, the election of Donald Trump as the 45th U.S. president and his subsequent policies and rhetoric, such as prioritizing American interests first, calling for a ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries, and introducing measures that affected immigrants and minorities, sparked controversy and debate around the world. Consequently, perceptions of America shifted, with some people viewing the country as more inward-focused, less welcoming, and increasingly polarized. In conclusion, the world's perception of America has evolved and changed over the years, impacted by significant events, political developments, and various global trends. The United States' position as a leading global power and its role in shaping the world has contributed to diverse and nuanced views of the country across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","output":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet is a combination of self-awareness, mild frustration, and ultimately, a sense of satisfaction or relief. The tweet indicates that the tweeter has just finished eating lunch, albeit later than their typical or preferred lunchtime. This suggests that they are conscious of their mealtime habits and might feel a slight sense of annoyance or even guilt that they ate lunch later than usual. The use of casual language and colloquial expressions like \\"kinda\\" and \\"at least\\" further illustrates a certain level of informality and familiarity with their audience. This informality can serve to dampen any perceived negativity associated with their late lunch while also acknowledging that a late lunch is not an ideal situation. The tweeter, using \\"@ least,\\" makes it a point to emphasize that they were eating, and from this, we can infer that they are trying to communicate two things: first, that a late lunch is not as bad as skipping a meal altogether; and second, that they are maintaining a positive attitude about the situation. Additionally, the use of an exclamation point at the end of the tweet may suggest excitement or enthusiasm. The tweeter could be using the exclamation point to show that, despite the late timing of their lunch, they are feeling a sense of accomplishment or enjoyment from having eaten. It is also possible that they are trying to create an inviting or light-hearted tone to encourage engagement with their audience. In summary, the sentiment embodied by this tweet is a mix of mild frustration due to eating lunch later than intended but also lighthearted satisfaction from having consumed the meal. The casual language and use of an exclamation point convey a friendly and upbeat tone, inviting their audience to share in their experience and possibly even engage with the tweet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as \\"Puzzle-free\\", that focuses on narrative, and \\"text adventures\\" that focus on puzzles.  - Brian Moriarty (born 1956) is an American video game developer who authored three of the original Infocom interactive fiction titles, \\"Wishbringer\\" (1985), \\"Trinity\\" (1986), and \\"Beyond Zork\\" (1987), as well as \\"Loom\\" (1990) for LucasArts.  - Beyond Zork (full title: \\"Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor\\") is an interactive fiction computer game written by Brian Moriarty and released by Infocom in 1987. It was one of the last games in Infocom's Zork series; or, rather, one of the last Zork games that many Infocom fans consider \\"official\\" (titles such as \\"\\" and \\"Zork Grand Inquisitor\\" were created after Activision had dissolved Infocom as a company and kept the \\"brand name\\"). It signified a notable departure from the standard format of Infocom's earlier games which relied purely on text and puzzle-solving: among other features, \\"Beyond Zork\\" incorporated a crude on-screen map, the use of character statistics and levels, and RPG combat elements.  - LucasArts Entertainment Company, LLC is an American video game publisher and licensor. Until 2013, it was also a video game developer. LucasArts is best known for its graphic adventure games, as well as games based on the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchises. Its headquarters are located in San Francisco, California.  - Infocom was a software company, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that produced numerous works of interactive fiction. They also produced one notable business application, a relational database called \\"Cornerstone\\".  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.

The last Monday in March is for students to learn it at school. It helps students learn more about  what  they should do to keep themselves safe. What are the accidents at school? Take a look. Stampedes , earthquakes and fires are the main accidents at school. A stampede always happens in crowded places. When students around you begin to push, just stand there and try to hold onto something. If you fall down in the crowd, move to one side and protect your head with your hands around. When earthquakes happen, you can get under a desk quickly and hold on. It'll protect you from falling things. If you are  outdoors, find a place away from buildings, trees, and power lines. When there's a fire, leave the classroom quickly. It's better to put  something wet over your mouth and nose. In this way, you won't breathe in smoke.

The lesser eyed hawkmoth (Smerinthus minor) is a moth of the family Sphingidae.        This piece of information tells us about the moth's classification, which doesn't provide any insight into its origin. 2. It was described by Mell in 1937.

If \\"Two men in western attire with a brown horse kicking into the air.\\", does this mean that \\"Two men playing with a dog in the playground\\"?","output":"No, the two phrases describe completely different scenarios despite both featuring interactions between individuals and animals. The phrase \\"two men in western attire with a brown horse kicking into the air\\" refers to an image or situation involving two men dressed in a western or cowboy-like fashion, together with a brown horse that is performing an action known as a kick, where the hind legs of the horse are swiftly and powerfully raised into the air. This scenario could potentially take place on a ranch, farm, or countryside setting, where horses are typically found, and the western attire of the men could indicate a rural or culturally associated connection with the location or activity. On the other hand, \\"two men playing with a dog in the playground\\" describes a completely different situation. This phrase suggests that two men are interacting with a dog, potentially playing a game or engaging in a fun activity, within a playground setting. A playground is a recreational area typically designed for children, sometimes featuring slides, swings, and other play structures. The presence of a dog in this setting would likely be because the two men are either dog owners or dog lovers who have brought the dog to play in a place where pets are allowed. The attire of the men is not mentioned in this phrase, and the animal involved is a dog rather than a horse. In conclusion, while both phrases depict scenarios where people are interacting with animals, they describe different situations, settings, animals, and potentially even different cultural contexts. \\"Two men in western attire with a brown horse kicking into the air\\" refers to a situation involving a horse and men dressed in western clothing, likely set in a rural or western environment.

Bill Shine Steps Out From Behind the Scenes to Lead Fox News Andrea Tantaros, a daytime host, said that when she complained about Mr. Ailes to Mr. Shine, he held an issue of Variety with Mr. Ailes’s picture on the cover and said, “Don’t fight this.” Mr. Shine, through a spokeswoman, said that Ms. Tantaros never approached him about Mr. Ailes’s harassing her. Laurie Luhn, a former booker at Fox, told New York magazine that Mr. Ailes enlisted Mr. Shine to recommend doctors and make travel arrangements for her while she was involved in a relationship with Mr. Ailes. Mr. Shine has told associates that he never knew that the two were romantically involved. In the television industry, Mr. Shine’s promotion was taken as a sign that Rupert Murdoch, who is now executive chairman of Fox News, does not intend a full-scale removal of people who worked closely with Ailes. It also suggested that Mr. Murdoch is enamored of Mr. Shine, who is now tasked with leading Fox News as CNN’s ratings surge and some popular anchors have suggested they may retire or leave the network. Silver-haired and bearded — with a facial scar picked up from a rowdy night in college — Mr. Shine is a Long Island native, who grew up past where the island’s electrified train tracks end. After college, he worked as a producer at local stations there. He married a fellow producer, Darla Seneck, and met Mr. Hannity, who was soon to start at Fox News. Producing “Hannity & Colmes,” Mr. Shine showed a knack for earning ratings and managing talent, quickly winning Mr. Ailes’s trust. When Ms. Van Susteren was lured to Fox from CNN, Mr. Shine was put in charge of her prime-time show. In news meetings, Mr. Shine is known less for voicing strident political views than for suggesting segments that prove popular with viewers, like stories about the gas tax. At Christmastime, he treats executive producers to lunch at a Midtown steakhouse. He can also be blunt when he needs to be. When Liz Claman, a Fox Business anchor, complained to Mr. Shine last year about what she viewed as too much politics in the coverage, Mr. Shine dismissed her complaint by noting that her ratings were among the lowest on the channel, according to a former employee at the network with direct knowledge of the conversation. His carrot-and-stick style impressed Mr. Ailes, who often asked Mr. Shine to handle an upset anchor. It was Mr. Shine who informed Mr. Hannity, in 2010, that he could not headline a Tea Party rally in Ohio; the two remain close. In 2004, Mr. Shine was directed by Mr. Ailes to mollify Susan Estrich, a lawyer and Fox News contributor, who was upset after the Democratic convention in Boston when fellow Democrats criticized her for appearing on the network, according to two executives familiar with the discussion. (Ms. Estrich is now defending Mr. Ailes in the harassment case brought against him by the former Fox host Gretchen Carlson.) Mr. Shine, a twin, was one of four children and grew up in a household where, according to his wife’s book, his parents sometimes went weeks without speaking. “He always said he would never want this for his marriage,” Darla Shine wrote, describing her husband as someone who doted on their children, and a romantic who likes to dance on dates. “Eat your hearts out,” she wrote. “He makes the beds on the weekend and will even do a few loads of laundry (including folding and putting away).” Ms. Shine’s book, published in 2005 by Judith Regan, then an executive at Fox News’s parent company, was a response to the series “Desperate Housewives.” The book urged women to “shut up, stop whining, and for goodness’ sake, stop nagging your husband.” Ms. Shine appeared on the “Today” show, and Mr. Shine told Newsday that he was unembarrassed by the sections in the book about the couple’s intimate life. “Hopefully, it’ll start a conversation between women and men and husbands and wives,” he told the paper. For Mr. Shine, it was a rare foray into the spotlight. In 20 years at Fox, he has eaten lunch at Michael’s, the Midtown media hangout, just once. Only this past year did he rent a Manhattan apartment to accommodate his longer hours. “What I love most about Bill is he’s a regular guy,” Maria Bartiromo, the Fox Business anchor, wrote in an email, in which she credited Mr. Shine for an increase in her ratings. “Very steady, very smart, and very genuine. He tells you the way it is. I appreciate that.” Fox News remains influential in Republican politics, but Mr. Shine is not registered in a political party. His wife, on her blog, occasionally delves into politics, writing last month, “I am afraid of our debt, afraid for my children, afraid we have lost the American Dream.” She has also described her concerns about the health effects of vaccinations. She writes glowingly about Mr. Shine. Among the glimpses into their life are photographs from last year’s White House Correspondents Dinner. In one image, Mr. Shine, in formal wear, is seen posing with eight female Fox anchors at his side. “Wow,” Ms. Shine wrote. “My husband is one lucky guy.” A version of this article appears in print on August 16, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Behind-the-Scenes Executive Steps Forward to Take a Starring Role at Fox News. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Bill Shine has taken on a major leadership role at Fox News following the resignation of Roger Ailes, the network's former chairman and CEO, who stepped down in the wake of sexual harassment allegations. Shine, a longtime Fox executive, is known for his ability to manage talent and earn ratings while remaining out of the spotlight himself. He has been tasked with leading Fox News as the network faces multiple challenges, including CNN's surging ratings and the potential departure of some popular anchors. The choice of Shine signals that Rupert Murdoch, now the network's executive chairman, does not intend to remove all executives who were close to Ailes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Charlottenlund is a suburban area on the coast north of Copenhagen, Denmark. It is the administrative seat of Gentofte Municipality. Bordered to the east by the Øresund, to the South by Hellerup and to the north by Klampenborg, it is one of the most wealthy areas in Denmark.

In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \\"suburb\\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \\"neighborhood\\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - An \\"aquatic animal\\" is an animal, either vertebrate or invertebrate, which lives in water for most or all of its life. It may breathe air or extract its oxygen from that dissolved in water through specialised organs called gills, or directly through its skin. Natural environments and the animals that live in them can be categorized as aquatic (water) or terrestrial (land).  - The Øresund/Öresund/Oresund Bridge (, , hybrid name: \\"\\") is a combined railway and motorway bridge across the Øresund strait between Sweden and Denmark. The bridge runs nearly from the Swedish coast to the artificial island Peberholm in the middle of the strait. The crossing is completed by the Drogden Tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Amager (or, especially among older speakers) is a Danish island in the Øresund. The Danish capital, Copenhagen, is partly situated on Amager, which is connected to the much larger island of Zealand by five bridges. Amager also has a connection across the Øresund to Sweden, the Øresund Bridge. Its western part begins with a tunnel from Amager to another Danish island, Peberholm. Copenhagen Airport is located on the island, around from Copenhagen city centre. Amager is the largest island in the Øresund, and the only one with a large population. , 192,709 people live on the island, including its northern tip, Christianshavn. The northern part is included in the Copenhagen municipality. The middle part comprises Tårnby municipality, and Dragør municipality is located on the southeast part of the island. Most of the western part is land that was reclaimed from the sea from the 1930s-1950s. This enlargement, from the shallow sound towards Zealand, is known as \\"Kalveboderne\\". The enlargement has never been built-up and its soil isn't suitable for agricultural use. However the area between Dragør town and the airport is cultivated land of high quality. Amager has in the past been referred to as the \\"kitchen of Copenhagen\\". At the border of the enlargement there is an old beech forest, \\"Kongelunden\\" (The King's Grove).  - Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup or Copenhagen Airport is the main international airport serving Copenhagen, Denmark, the entire Zealand, the Øresund Region, and a large part of southern Sweden (not only Scania). It is the largest airport in the Nordic countries with 29 million passengers in 2016 and one of the oldest international airports in Europe. It is the third-busiest airport in Northern Europe, and by far the busiest for international travel in Scandinavia.  - An aquarium (plural: \\"aquariums\\" or \\"aquaria\\") is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which water-dwelling plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term, coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root \\"aqua\\", meaning water, with the suffix \\"-arium\\", meaning \\"a place for relating to\\". The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington, who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large. The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and published the first manual, \\"The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea\\" in 1854.  - Copenhagen (, ); ) is the capital and most populated city of Denmark. It has a municipal population of 591,481 and a larger urban population of 1,280,371. The Copenhagen metropolitan area has just over 2 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and is separated from Malmö, Sweden, by the strait of Øresund. The Øresund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road.  - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).  - A zoo (short for zoological garden or zoological park and also called an animal park or menagerie) is a facility in which animals are confined within enclosures, displayed to the public, and in which they may also breed.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.

The artist had been diagnosed with bile duct cancer. The Doors formed in 1965 after Manzarek happened to meet Jim Morrison on California's Venice Beach. The legendary rock group went on to sell 100 million albums worldwide, establishing five multiplatinum discs in the U.S. Morrison died in 1971, but Manzarek carried on The Doors' legacy, continuing to work as a musician and an author. \\"I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of my friend and bandmate Ray Manzarek today,\\" said Doors guitarist Robby Krieger. \\"I'm just glad to have been able to have played Doors songs with him for the last decade. Ray was a huge part of my life and I will always miss him.\\" The band famously defied Ed Sullivan's request that they not sing the lyric \\"higher\\" when they performed \\"Light My Fire\\" on his show in 1969. A show producer approached them in the dressing room shortly before they were to perform, Manzarek recalled in an interview with CNN in 2002. Manzarek remembers the band publicly agreeing like choirboys. \\" 'Yes, sir,' we told him,\\" he recalls. \\"'Whatever you say, sir. We'll change.' (The producer) looked at Jim and said, 'You're the poet. Think of something else -- 'wire,' 'flyer.' \\" Then the Doors went out and did the song exactly as they always did. Sullivan was so furious he didn't even shake their hands. Manzarek went on to produce the Los Angeles punk band X. Bassist John Doe said the band learned a lot from him. \\"To have someone like Ray -- like rock 'n' roll royalty -- embrace what we do, it was great for our confidence,\\" Doe told CNN in a 2004 interview. \\"In the studio, he knew what to try to do. He went for performance. He was smart enough to realize that the band had the arrangements all worked out.\\" Manzarek is survived by his brothers Rick and James, his wife Dorothy, his son Pablo, and three grandchildren.

What is the full name of the character who overpays his accountant?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Young filmmaker Stevie Horowitz eagerly awaits a meeting with big shot Hollywood film producer J.P. Shelldrake. Shelldrake has been desperately searching for a way to avoid problems with the IRS and unpaid millions owed them in back taxes. His brilliant yet overpaid accountant devises a scheme to allow the producer to write off the expenses of his next movie release, but only if the film is a box office flop. Armed with his foolproof plan, Shelldrake agrees to meet with Stevie and screen his film \\"Lobster Man From Mars\\" (financed by Stevie's jailed con man Uncle Joey).

Options: - theater - airplane - theatre - new york city - fieldhouse  The answer is \\"fieldhouse\\" because","output":"a fieldhouse is generally a large enclosed area designed for indoor sports or athletic events which might include track and field or baseball. This type of facility typically has a large central area for sports and may also contain locker rooms, showers, or other amenities. While it is theoretically possible to stage a fashion show or other event that would include a catwalk in a space like this, that is not its primary or customary usage. On the other hand, catwalks are commonly associated with theaters and theatres (the different spellings refer to the same type of establishment, just in American and British English respectively). In this context, a catwalk refers to a platform used by stagehands and technicians to access the overhead stage lights and scenery. Additionally, professional fashion shows (which are also commonly associated with the term 'catwalk') are often held in theatre spaces due to the ease of viewing provided by the stepped seating. Airplanes, more specifically large commercial ones, also have an area that could be referred to as a catwalk. It's a narrow, usually unseen walkway running the length of the plane used for maintenance, inspections and in case of emergencies. New York City is a recognized hub for fashion globally and it's common for significant fashion events, which would feature catwalks, to be held here. Therefore, out of all the options, a catwalk would be least likely to be found in a fieldhouse due to its primary function as a sports facility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, this isn’t always the case, and you may need additional treatment. Talk to your doctor to find out what type of treatment you need. Back pain typically causes the following symptoms:  Muscle aches. Dull, shooting, or stabbing pain. Back pain that gets worse when you bend, lift, stand, or walk. Back pain that feels better when you lie down. Try not to worry, but these symptoms may be a sign of a more serious condition. Your doctor can figure out what’s causing your symptoms and can recommend the best treatments for you. See your doctor immediately to get the treatment you need. Tell your doctor how long you’ve been experiencing these symptoms. While you likely don’t need to worry, back pain can sometimes be a sign of a more serious condition. If this is the case, you may need additional treatment. Visit your doctor or go to an emergency room if you have the following symptoms:  Bowel or bladder problems—especially if you can’t control urination. Fever. Back injury from a fall or accident. If you have a history of drug or alcohol abuse, are older than 50, or have a bone or joint disorder, the back pain is more likely to get out of control if you don’t get a thorough exam. Additionally, if you have a family history of cancer, back pain may be an early sign of spinal, colon, or ovarian cancer. You’re probably fine, but it’s a good idea to get screened just to be safe. It’s rare for back pain to be a sign of cancer, but it’s worth checking out if the back pain came out of nowhere and wasn’t triggered by physical activity. Your doctor will review your symptoms and do a physical exam. Then, they may order some simple diagnostic tests. Most of these tests will be non-invasive and painless, but you may experience some discomfort. After the tests, talk to your doctor about your diagnosis.  For instance, your doctor will probably do an imaging test. You may need to complete an X-ray, MRI, CT scan, or ultrasound. In some cases, your doctor may inject you with a contrast dye so they can look for back problems, like a herniated disc, fracture, or spondylolisthesis. Your doctor can tell you about all of your treatment options. For minor back pain, exercise and over-the-counter pain relievers may be enough to help your back pain. However, they may prescribe additional medication or recommend physical therapy. For severe cases, your doctor may recommend you get surgery, but only as a last resort. Try not to worry because you have a lot of treatment options. Your doctor can help you figure out what’s best for you.","output":"Back pain is a common issue that often resolves itself with home treatment and self-care.

With Jay Cutler sidelined, Matt Barkley made his first career NFL start against a Dick LeBeau-led defense that blitzed often; on second down, the Titans recorded 12 sacks, second-most in the league. For the Bears defense, they faced an offense powered by a running game featuring DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry, while quarterback Marcus Mariota led a unit that ranked eighth in the NFL in five-minute drives and a fifth-ranked third down conversion rate. Despite the recent woes, Jeff Joniak wrote the Bears needed to maintain a high morale and allow younger players to develop, both as players and as a team. On their opening drive, the Bears reached the Titans' 33-yard line before stalling and turning the ball over on downs. After the Titans punted, the Bears scored first when Barkley threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Daniel Brown, their first career touchdowns. The Titans responded with Henry's 11-yard touchdown run with four seconds left in the first quarter, followed by Mariota throwing a four-yard touchdown pass to Delanie Walker in the second quarter. Chicago attempted to score again when they entered Tennessee's red zone on their next drive, but Barkley's pass for Ben Braunecker was intercepted by Wesley Woodyard. The next two drives of the game ended with a punt before Mariota threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Rishard Matthews to give the Titans a 21-7 entering halftime. To start the second half, Connor Barth attempted a surprise onside kick, which bounced off Titan Nate Palmer as Adrian Amos recovered. The Bears took advantage to drive to the Titan's five-yard line, but were unable to score as Barkley's pass for Cameron Meredith was intercepted by Da'Norris Searcy in the endzone. Tennessee's Ryan Succop kicked field goals of 19 and 31 yards to increase the lead to 20 points. In the fourth quarter, Barkley began to lead a comeback as he led a 75-yard drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson, followed by a 69-yard scoring drive that concluded with a six-yard touchdown pass to Deonte Thompson to narrow the score to 27-21. The Titans were forced to punt on their next possession with 1:56 left in the game. Barkley moved the Bears downfield with 14-, 21- and 23-yard passes to Wilson, where they reached the Titans' seven-yard line to create a first-and-goal situation with 47 seconds left. Barkley's first pass to Josh Bellamy, which would have resulted in a touchdown, was dropped. His next two passes to Brown and Thompson also fell incomplete. On fourth-and-goal, Thompson dropped a Barkley pass in the back of the endzone to result in a turnover on downs. In addition to the two late drops by Bellamy and Thompson, the Bears as a whole struggled with drops, with ten total in the game and eight in the fourth quarter. Who caught Barkley's first career touchdown?","output":"Daniel Brown caught Barkley's first career touchdown."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions (or color centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in photochromic glasses). Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and Cr2O3 additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide. When used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and 'cook' times. Most colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who serve this market although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make their own color from raw materials. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What other additives can give glass a sulfur tint?","output":"Well, kiddo, to make glass have a sulfur tint, which is like a yellow or amber color, people can add some stuff called sulfur with other things like carbon and iron salts.

Is the admiration for the British royal family rooted in racism? Is it compulsory for members of the British Royal Family to serve in the armed forces? Do those questions have the same meaning? OPT: a). no b). yes","output":"a). No, the two questions do not have the same meaning. Each question addresses a separate aspect of the British royal family and alludes to different discussions. For the first question, \\"Is the admiration for the British royal family rooted in racism?\\": The question is fundamentally asking whether the affection and esteem in which the British royal family is held are based on racist principles. The admiration for the British royal family could stem from different factors such as tradition, culture, history, and the roles they play in society. Though there might be historical connections to colonialism and imperialism, attributing the modern admiration for the royal family solely to racism is an oversimplification. It is important, however, to acknowledge and recognize the multifaceted aspects that contribute to the admiration of the British royal family, which could range from deeply ingrained societal values, fascination with the monarchy, and a genuine appreciation for the philanthropic work they do. For the second question, \\"Is it compulsory for members of the British Royal Family to serve in the armed forces?\\": This question seeks clarification on whether military service is mandatory for members of the British royal family. Historically, many members of the British royal family have served in the armed forces, predominantly due to a close relationship between the monarchy and the military. While it is not compulsory for all members of the royal family to serve, it has become somewhat of a tradition for certain members to pursue military careers, and in some cases assume ceremonial military roles. For instance, Prince Charles, Prince William, and Prince Harry have all served in various branches of the military. However, this is not a formal requirement of being a member of the British royal family. It is important to note that royal family members actively involved in the military are subject to the same standards and expectations as their fellow servicemen and servicewomen.  In summary, the two questions focus on different aspects of the British royal family – the first addresses the origins of admiration, potentially touching on sensitive topics like racism, while the second tackles the subject of whether military service is obligatory for the members of the monarchy. Thus, the answer is option a): No, these questions do not have the same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - lake - ocean - tetrahedron - mirror - object Answer:","output":"The most suitable option for answering the question \\"Boats that aren't on the ocean travel across the surface of what?\\" is lake.  Lakes are large bodies of water, usually found inland, that provide an ideal environment for various types of boats to travel across their surfaces. While the term \\"lake\\" is quite general and encompasses a wide range of sizes, depths, and characteristics, they all share the common trait of providing a suitable surface for boats to traverse. Boats are designed for different purposes and environments, and many of them are adaptable to both ocean and lake settings. In comparison to the vastness of the ocean, lakes typically offer calmer waters, making it easier for smaller boats to navigate and traverse without the risk of being overwhelmed by large waves or harsh weather conditions. Recreational boating is a common activity on lakes, with a variety of watercraft available to suit different needs and preferences. Some examples include sailing boats, rowing boats, kayaks, canoes, and even motorboats. Each type of watercraft offers a unique experience for those who travel across the surface of a lake, providing opportunities for leisure, exercise, and exploration. In addition to recreational boating, lakes also provide a setting for professional boating activities such as competitive events and water-based sports. Rowing, sailing, and canoe racing are just a few examples of sports that take place on lakes. These events require a suitable body of water with relatively calm conditions, making lakes an ideal location for this type of activity. The other options provided in the question, ocean, tetrahedron, mirror, and object, are less suitable answers for the given context. While ocean and lake may both serve as travel environments for boats, the question specifically asks about boats that aren't on the ocean. Tetrahedron is a geometrical figure and is irrelevant to the context of boats and water surfaces. A mirror, although associated with reflecting surfaces, cannot support the physical traversal of a boat. Lastly, an object is a general term that can refer to any item or entity, making it an unsuitable and vague answer. In conclusion, the most suitable option for answering the question about where boats that aren't on the ocean travel across is a lake. This body of water provides an appropriate environment for boats to traverse, both for recreational and professional purposes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the United States, \\"officer\\" usually is the formal name of the lowest police rank. In many other countries, \\"officer\\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often \\"constable\\". In some nations the use of the rank \\"officer\\" is legally reserved for military personnel. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to dissimulate as ordinary citizens.  - Special police (also see Auxiliary police) usually describes a police force or unit within a police force whose duties and responsibilities are significantly different from other forces in the same country or from other police in the same force, although there is no consistent international definition. A special constable, in most cases, is not a member of a special police force; in countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and often elsewhere, a special constable is a voluntary or part-time member of a national or local police force or a person involved in law enforcement who is not a police officer but has some of the powers of a police officer.  - Concurrent jurisdiction exists where two or more courts from different systems simultaneously have jurisdiction over a specific case. This situation leads to forum shopping, as parties will try to have their civil or criminal case heard in the court that they perceive will be most favorable to them.   - Community Safety Accreditation Schemes are a means by which the Chief Constable of a police force in the United Kingdom may grant a limited range of police powers to employees of non-police organisations who contribute towards community safety. Community Safety Accreditation Schemes were created under section 40 of the Police Reform Act 2002. Individuals who have been granted these powers are known under the Act as Accredited Persons.  - In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes. These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole and probation. A typical \\"correctional institution\\" is a prison. A \\"correctional system\\", also known as a \\"penal system\\", thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons and community-based programs like parole and probation boards;. This system is part of the larger criminal justice system, which additionally includes police, prosecution and courts. Jurisdictions throughout Canada and the US have ministries or departments, respectively, of corrections, correctional services, or similarly-named agencies.  - Michele Marie Leonhart ( born February 27 , 1956 ) is an American career law enforcement officer and the former Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) . After the resignation of Administrator Karen P. Tandy in the fall of 2007 , Leonhart also served as Acting Administrator of the DEA . On February 2 , 2010 , President Barack Obama nominated Leonhart for the position of DEA Administrator . Leonhart 's tenure as DEA Administrator was marked with controversy and scandals including a prostitution scandal ; by the end of her service in April 2015 , she was labelled \`\` embattled '' when a bipartisan group of lawmakers declared that they had no confidence in her leadership . On April 21 , she conveyed to Attorney General Eric Holder that she intended to resign the following month .  - In the United States, a special agent is usually a detective or investigator for a state, county, municipal, federal, or tribal government who primarily serve in investigatory roles. Within the United States' federal law enforcement system, dozens of federal agencies employ federal law enforcement officers, each with different criteria pertaining to the use of the titles \\"\\"Special Agent\\"\\" versus \\"\\"Agent\\"\\". In intelligence usage, agent refers to one who is recruited, trained, controlled and employed to obtain and report information.  - The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is the statute establishing federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated. It was passed by the 91st United States Congress as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.  - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing.  - The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, tasked with combating drug smuggling and use within the United States. The DEA is the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security, and the U.S. Border Patrol. It has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations both domestic, and abroad.  - The role of Immigration officers is to ensure that immigration legislation is enforced. This can cover the rules of entry for visa applicants, foreign nationals or those seeking asylum at the border, detecting and apprehending those that have breached the border and removing them, or pursuing those in breach of immigration and criminal laws.  - Parole officers and probation officers play a role in the criminal justice systems by supervising offenders released from incarceration or sentenced to non-custodial sanctions such as community service. In some jurisdictions parole or probation officers are involved in presenting reports on offenders and making sentencing recommendation to courts of law.  - Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American to serve as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004.  - Homeland security is an American umbrella term for \\"the national effort to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of life can thrive to the national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the U.S. to terrorism, and minimize the damage from attacks that do occur.\\"  - The Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI, is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States, which simultaneously serves as the nation's prime federal law enforcement agency. Operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI is concurrently a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. A leading U.S. counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes.  - A law enforcement officer (LEO) or peace officer, in North American English, is a public-sector employee whose duties primarily involve the enforcement of laws. The phrase can include police officers, municipal law enforcement officers, special police officers, customs officers, state troopers, special agents, special investigators, border patrol officers, immigration officers, court officers, probation officers, parole officers, arson investigators, auxiliary officers, game wardens, sheriffs, corrections, marshals, and deputies. Security guards are civilians and therefore not law enforcement officers, unless they have been granted powers to enforce particular laws, such as those accredited under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme. Although typically the term \\"law enforcement officer\\" refers to those government agents with police powers, prosecutors are also law enforcement officers.  - A sheriff is a government official, with varying duties, existing in some countries with historical ties to England, where the office originated. There is an analogous although independently developed office in Iceland that is commonly translated to English as \\"sheriff,\\" and this is discussed below.  - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - An officer is a person who has a position of authority in a hierarchical organization.  - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who was alienated from Johnson due to doubts concerning the 1965 bombing of North Vietnam?  Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964...

New York (CNN) -- When Gina Keatley first moved to New York to attend culinary school, she noticed that many of her neighbors were missing limbs. \\"I lived on 99th Street across from some projects,\\" she said. \\"I would walk to the train and think, 'Why are there so many amputees?'\\" Keatley found out that many of them had to have amputations because of complications from diabetes. Diabetes can reduce blood flow to extremities and cause nerve damage, and sometimes amputations are necessary if serious infection sets in and there is severe damage to the tissue and bone. The neighborhood where Keatley lived, East Harlem, has the highest diabetes rate in Manhattan, according to city health officials. It also has the highest obesity rate: One-third of adult residents are obese or overweight. Since then, the 8-year-old and his family have been frequenting their local farmers' market in","output":"East Harlem, joining a growing number of residents who are determined to fight the epidemic of diabetes and obesity plaguing their community. Keatley, now a certified nutritionist, took it upon herself to make a difference in the lives of the people around her, especially those who are most vulnerable to the effects of this debilitating disease. To combat the issue, Keatley established a nonprofit organization called \\"Nutrition for Life,\\" which focuses on educating residents about healthy eating habits and empowering them to make sustainable dietary changes. Through her organization, she organizes cooking classes, grocery store tours, and workshops in East Harlem schools, churches, and community centers, teaching participants how to prepare affordable and nutritious meals with ingredients easily found in their neighborhood. Realizing the importance of accessible and healthy food options in the community, Keatley also began working closely with local farmers' markets and other community organizations to help improve the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables. This included advocating for more farmers' markets in the area and implementing initiatives like the \\"Double Up Food Bucks\\" program, which provides additional benefits to SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) participants when they purchase fresh produce at participating markets. In addition to increasing access to fresh and healthy food options, Keatley and her Nutrition for Life team have worked to develop culturally relevant educational materials and programs in order to resonate with East Harlem's diverse population. By taking into account cultural backgrounds, dietary preferences, and cooking traditions from different ethnicities, Keatley believes that her organization can make a genuine impact in the fight against diabetes and obesity in the community. The efforts of Keatley, her nonprofit, and the broader East Harlem community have started to show promising results. More residents are now aware of the importance of healthy eating and the potential consequences of not taking care of their bodies. They're also realizing that making healthier food choices doesn't necessarily mean giving up on the foods they love, but rather finding more balanced and nutritious alternatives. Families like the one mentioned earlier, who once faced an uncertain future due to the prevalence of diabetes and obesity in their neighborhood, have been given a newfound sense of hope. They have become regulars at the farmers' market and are actively taking charge of their own health by learning about nutrition and incorporating healthier ingredients in their daily meals. As more members of the East Harlem community take these crucial steps toward better health, the hope is that the alarming statistics plaguing this neighborhood will gradually diminish, ultimately turning the tide against this modern-day epidemic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: name = The Waterman, food = Chinese, priceRange = cheap, customer rating = average, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"Certainly. The information provided in the sentence can be best represented in a structured data form such as a dictionary or a relational database record in a tabular format. A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs; a relational database, on the other hand, is a type of database that organizes data into tables. Here are the two formats: 1) Representation as a Python dictionary: Python dictionaries are capable of storing data in key-value pairs. In this language, the keys function as identifiers that help in sorting and calling the values attached to them. Values can be any form of information, including but not limited to strings, integers, and objects.  For our purposes, the dictionary would look something like this: \`\`\`python restaurant_information = {     \\"name\\": \\"The Waterman\\",      \\"food\\": \\"Chinese\\",      \\"priceRange\\": \\"cheap\\",      \\"customer rating\\": \\"average\\",      \\"area\\": \\"city centre\\",      \\"familyFriendly\\": \\"yes\\" } \`\`\` In this dictionary, the keys are the identifiers, such as \\"name,\\" \\"food,\\" and \\"priceRange,\\" and the values are the related specific details like \\"The Waterman,\\" \\"cheap,\\" and \\"Chinese.\\" 2) Representation as a relational database record: In this form, each piece of data corresponds to a column in the table, while each restaurant's data makes up a single row. To represent the information in your sentence, we would likely utilize a table called \\"Restaurants\\" with columns for Name, Food, Price Range, Customer Rating, Area, and Family Friendly. A single entry, or record, within that table might look something like this: | Name         | Food    | Price Range | Customer Rating | Area        | Family Friendly | | ------------ | ------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------- | --------------- | | The Waterman | Chinese | Cheap       | Average         | City Centre | Yes             | This layout helps organize multiple records efficiently, making it easier to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data.

The animal was mauled in a dogfight so Monty intends to shoot him, but changes his mind after he looks it in the eye. Monty decides to take the dog to a nearby clinic instead. Fast forward to late 2002. Monty is about to begin serving a seven-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. He sits in a park with Doyle, the dog he rescued, on his last day of freedom. He plans to meet childhood friends Frank Slaughtery and Jacob Elinsky at a club with his girlfriend Naturelle. Frank is a hotshot trader on Wall Street; Jacob is an introverted high school teacher with a crush on 17-year-old Mary, one of his students. Monty visits his father, James, a former firefighter and recovering alcoholic who owns a bar, to confirm their plans to drive to the prison the following morning. Monty's drug money helped James keep the bar, so a remorseful James sneaks a drink when Monty goes to the bathroom. Facing himself in the mirror, Monty lashes out in his mind against everyone else: all the New York stereotypes he can think of, from the cabbies to the firefighters, the corner grocers to the mobsters, as if he hates them all. Finally, he turns on himself, revealing that he is actually angry for getting greedy and having not given up drug dealing before he was caught.

They find the drugs immediately and not after any real search, suggesting that Monty had been betrayed. Monty sold drugs for Uncle Nikolai, a Russian mobster. Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who turned him in, since she knew where he hid his drugs and money. Monty refused to turn state's evidence against Nikolai, but he's not sure what Nikolai will do at the club that night.

She realizes that the quake has opened a deep fault running through the center of North America, ending at the San Andreas Fault. Any further instability will cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis, devastating Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities all around the Pacific Ocean, leading to the deaths of millions. Dr. Lane and Boomer chase just behind the expanding crack in the Earth's crust, developing a plan to stop the next quake. They decide to use a satellite orbiting above the continent which can trigger earthquakes. They fire it off when they reach the Grand Canyon, thinking that when the new fault hits the canyon it will be forced to turn south into the Gulf of Mexico. When the fault crosses with the canyon, the plan goes wrong. Instead of heading south it travels north, towards the Yellowstone Caldera. They realize that if the fault crosses with the caldera it would erupt, expelling 2,000,000 tons of ash into the atmosphere, killing millions immediately and causing a Volcanic winter.

Hearing about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail. While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death, Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family, unaware of the lack of support there. Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I's forces led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed. There were 200 people in Husayn's caravan, many of whom were women, including his sisters, wives, daughters and their children. The women and children from Husayn's camp were taken as prisoners of war and led back to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. They remained imprisoned until public opinion turned against him as word of Husayn's death and his family's capture spread. They were then granted passage back to Medina.

Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Portrays the life of a mangrove Review: Most striking is the artwork. The pictures are truly very engaging and magical, even for a three year old. The story told by the drawings themselves is most compelling--simply the life of a mangrove (tangle) over many years and through many storms (harboring many animals). The story shows how it sprouts from a floating seed. Very relevant book for anyone visiting or living near mangroves. The text is nice too; however, too dry for a small child. I give it four rather than five stars because I felt the text could have been more engaging. Answer: Answer:","output":"To determine the tone of this product review, I will analyze the language and sentiments expressed by the reviewer, focusing on their praises and criticisms. 1. The reviewer praises the artwork, calling it \\"engaging\\", \\"magical\\", and \\"compelling\\". This suggests a positive tone. 2. They appreciate the story portrayed through the drawings and find it relevant for people living near mangroves. This is another positive point. 3. The reviewer mentions that the text is \\"nice\\", which implies a slightly positive tone. 4. However, they feel that the text is too dry for small children, presenting a negative aspect. 5. The review gives the product four out of five stars, suggesting that the reviewer's overall assessment is positive but with some drawbacks. Considering the mentioned positive and negative points, the tone of this product review leans more towards the positive side, but with constructive criticism.

(June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An unnamed gunslinger referred to as The Lady enters the Old West town of Redemption circa 1881, where she enters a single elimination gunfighting contest held by Redemption's ruthless mayor and former outlaw John Herod. While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything. During a rainstorm that evening The Lady faces off with Eugene Dred after Dred rapes a young girl at the saloon. She defeats him...

Context: The French Marines and naval infantry intended for the invasion of northern Germany were dispatched to reinforce the French Army of Châlons and fell into captivity at Sedan along with Napoleon III. A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile. As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter. The rest of the navy retired to ports along the English Channel and remained in port for the rest of the war.

Sound waves are created as the air vibrates in response to a person's speech or other sounds. A second person's ear collects these sound waves and converts them into nerve impulses which their brain interprets as sound. In normal speech these waves travel through the air, but with a tin can telephone the waves are transmitted through an additional medium of cups and string. What's the best answer to this question: does a tin can and string really work?","output":"To determine the best answer for whether a tin can telephone really works, we need to examine the components of the system and the effectiveness of sound transmission. Step 1: Understand a tin can telephone system A tin can telephone consists of two tin cans (or plastic cups) connected by a taut string. The assumption is that when a person talks into one can, sound travels through the string and is audible to the listener at the other can. Step 2: Assess the effectiveness of sound transmission The key factor in a tin can telephone's success lies in preserving the integrity of the sound waves as they travel through the system. Sound waves need a medium to propagate, and the taut string provides that medium. When a person speaks into a can, the can vibrates, causing the string to vibrate as well. These vibrations travel along the string to the other can, where they are converted back into sound waves. Step 3: Consider factors that influence sound quality Various factors influence the sound quality of a tin can telephone: 1. Material: The cans and string must be made of materials that effectively transmit sound vibrations. Tin cans or plastic cups usually work well for the cans, while a tightly-stretched nylon string is a good choice for the string. 2. String tension: The string must be taut to maintain the integrity of the sound waves. A loose string will dampen vibrations and decrease sound quality. 3. Distance: The length of the string affects the sound quality. The longer the string, the more energy is lost in transmission, decreasing the sound quality. After considering these factors and the means through which a tin can telephone functions, the best answer to the question is: Yes, a tin can and string can really work as a simplistic means of communication, transmitting sound between two points. However, the effectiveness and quality of sound largely depend on the materials used, string tension, and distance between the cans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which team allowed the most points in the first quarter?","output":"Title: Which Team Allowed the Most Points in the First Quarter? Hi, little friends! Today, we are going to talk about basketball. 🏀 Do you like watching basketball games? In basketball, two teams play against each other, and they try to score points by putting the ball through the hoop. The team that scores the most points wins! But sometimes, teams have a hard time defending their hoop, which means they let the other team score many points. We are going to find out which team allowed the most points in the first quarter.  In a basketball game, there are four quarters. Each quarter is 12 minutes long. The first quarter is the start of the game. Sometimes, teams start the game slowly, maybe because they are nervous, or they are not warmed-up, or they are just having a bad day.  Now, let's talk about the team that allowed the most points in the first quarter. This can change every season since teams play many games and the players might change too. In the NBA (that's the professional basketball league in the USA 🇺🇸), it is common for teams to give up about 25 to 30 points in the first quarter. But, sometimes teams end up giving up lots more points! 😮 To find out which team allowed the most points in the first quarter, you can look up the basketball statistics. The statistics will tell you how many points each team scored and how many they let other teams score. You can find this information online or in the sports section of a newspaper. Once you find the statistics, you should look for the team that has the highest number of points allowed in the first quarter. That is the team that let other teams score the most points! Oh no! 🙁 But, don't worry, even if a team has a bad start in the first quarter, they can still come back and win the game. That's the beauty of sports! 😊 So now you know how to find which team allowed the most points in the first quarter. It's fun to learn about basketball, isn't it? But remember, playing basketball is even more fun. Let's go grab a ball and shoot some hoops! 🎉 Happy playing, and remember to always have fun! 🌟"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, Russian media suggested a Russian athlete in the Sochi Games may have been sporting an image supporting Pussy Riot on his snowboard Thursday in what could be the Olympics' first protest. In the diplomatic dispute, Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, apparently initiated the exchange with a Russian counterpart when she tweeted Wednesday about meeting formerly imprisoned band members Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, both of whom were released in December. Power posted a photograph of herself with the two punk rockers, who \\"came by to discuss their time in jail,\\" Power tweeted. She also stated: \\"Met some brave 'troublemakers' today.\\" . Power subsequently tweeted: \\"I asked #PussyRiot if they were afraid of prison. Response: No. In prison we could see the terrible conditions. It's human rights fieldwork.\\" Then the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, told a U.N. press conference that Power should join the band and invite them to play at the National Cathedral in Washington. Power responded on Twitter: \\"Ambassador Churkin, I'd be honored to go on tour with #PussyRiot -- a group of girls who speak up & stand for human rights. Will you join us?\\" Power also added: \\"I can't sing, but if #PussyRiot will have me, Amb Churkin, I say our 1st concert is for Russia's pol. prisoners. #LiveFromMatrosskayaTishina.\\" Matrosskaya Tishina is a notorious Moscow prison where opposition activists have been held.

The three members were sentenced to prison after performing a song critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals in February 2012. The performance was carried out in a flash-mob style. Meanwhile, the Russian state-run media agency RIA Novosti reported Thursday that Russian athlete Alexei Sobolev sported an image on his snowboard resembling \\"a female figure in a balaclava wielding a knife.\\" That image purports to resemble members of Pussy Riot because the anti-Putin, all-female band perform while wearing balaclavas, the news agency reported.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Structural engineering is mainly a sub-division of civil engineering where structural engineers are trained to understand, predict, and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings and non-building structures, to develop designs and integrate their design with that of other designers, and to supervise construction of projects on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles etc. where structural integrity affects functioning and safety.  - Structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized. Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.  - Civil Engineering History of the civil engineering profession. Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, and Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and sailing.  - Medical equipment (also known as armamentarium) is designed to aid in the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of medical conditions.  - Structural engineers analyze, design, plan, and research structural components and structural systems to achieve design goals and ensure the safety and comfort of users or occupants. Their work takes account mainly of safety, technical, economic and environmental concerns, but they may also consider aesthetic and social factors.  - The term structural system or structural frame in structural engineering refers to load - resisting sub-system of a structure . The structural system transfers loads through interconnected structural components or members . Commonly used structures can be classified into five major categories , depending on the type of primary stress that may arise in the members of the structures under major design loads . However any two or more of the basic structural types described in the following may be combined in a single structure , such as a building or a bridge in order to meet the structures functional requirements . Tensile structures : Members of tensile structures are subjects to pure tension under the action of external loads . Because the tensile stress is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area of members , the material of such a structure is utilized in the most efficient manner . Compressive structures : Compression structures develop mainly compressive stresses under the action of axial loads . Because compressive structures are susceptible to buckling or instability , the possibility of such a failure should be considered in their designs if necessary , adequate bracing must be provided to avoid such failures . Trusses : Trusses are composed of straight members connected at their ends by hinged connections to form a stable configuration . Because of their light weight and high strength , are among the most commonly used type of structure . Shear structures : These are structures such as reinforced concrete shear walls , which are used in multistory buildings to reduce lateral movements due to wind loads and earthquake excitations . Shear structures develop mainly in - plane shear with relatively small bending stresses under the action of external loads . Bending structures : Bending structures develop mainly bending stresses under the action of external loads . The shear stresses associated with the changes in bending moments may also be significant should be considered in their designs .  - Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns). Design has different connotations in different fields (see design disciplines below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, coding, and graphic design) is also considered to be design.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'structural system' exhibits the relationship of 'subclass of'. Find the answer from the choices below.  Choices: - aid  - arrangement  - aspect  - building  - civil engineering  - computer  - computer science  - construction  - convention  - data  - design  - division  - engineering  - equipment  - human  - lattice  - man  - management  - material  - musical form  - natural  - network  - object  - research  - sewing  - stability  - structure  - system  - valley Answer:","output":"structure"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits Context: Crowded House were midway through a US tour when Paul Hester quit the band on 15 April 1994. He flew home to Melbourne to await the birth of his first child and indicated that he required more time with his family. Wally Ingram, drummer for support act Sheryl Crow, temporarily filled in until a replacement, Peter Jones (ex-Harem Scarem, Vince Jones, Kate Ceberano's Septet) was found. After the tour, the Finn Brothers released their album Finn in November 1995. In June 1996, at a press conference to announce the release of their greatest hits album Recurring Dream, Neil revealed that Crowded House were to disband. The June 1996 concerts in Europe and Canada were to be their final performances.  Recurring Dream contained four songs from each of the band's studio albums, along with three new songs. The album debuted at number one in Australia, New Zealand and the UK in July 1996. Early copies included a bonus CD of live material. The album's three new songs, which were released as singles, were \\"Instinct\\", \\"Not the Girl You Think You Are\\" and \\"Everything Is Good for You\\", which featured backing vocals from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Paul Hester returned to the band to play drums on the three new tracks.  Worried that their goodbye had been too low-key and had disregarded their home fans, the band performed the Farewell to the World concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on 24 November 1996, which raised funds for the Sydney Children's Hospital. The concert featured the line-up of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart and Paul Hester. Tim Finn and Peter Jones both made guest appearances. Support bands on the day were Custard, Powderfinger and You Am I. The concert had one of the highest live audiences in Australian history with the crowd being estimated at between 120,000 and 250,000 people. Farewell to the World was released on VHS in December 1996. In 2007, a double CD and a DVD were issued as to commemorate the concert's tenth anniversary. The DVD featured newly recorded audio commentary by Finn, Hart and Seymour and other new bonus material. Question: What year was this concert?.

A: Answer:","output":"The first discovery of the moons of Jupiter was made by Italian astronomer and mathematician Galileo Galilei in 1610. Hence, the correct answer is (D) Galileo. Galileo Galilei was born in Pisa, Italy, on February 15, 1564, and died in Arcetri, near Florence, on January 8, 1642. He was, without a doubt, one of the most significant figures in the history of science. His work laid the foundation for the modern scientific method and made vital contributions to the fields of astronomy, mathematics, and physics. In January 1610, while using an early prototype of the refracting telescope—an invention that he had recently improved—Galileo observed what appeared to be three small, bright objects in close proximity to Jupiter. He concluded that they were stars based on his initial observation, but as the nights passed, he noticed that they appeared to move relative to the planet. After further observation, Galileo discovered a fourth object and became convinced that these celestial bodies were not stars, but rather moons orbiting Jupiter. These discoveries had significant implications for the scientific community. Prior to this, it was widely believed that all celestial bodies revolved around the Earth in fixed orbits, a notion known as the geocentric model. However, the discovery of these moons challenged this belief and provided support for the heliocentric model—the idea that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. Galileo's groundbreaking observations of the moons of Jupiter ultimately led to the acceptance of the heliocentric model of our solar system, which replaced the previously dominant geocentric model. This, in turn, had a profound impact on the way people understood the universe. In honor of Galileo's discovery, the four largest moons of Jupiter are now collectively known as the Galilean moons. They are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons have been extensively studied in the centuries since their discovery, revealing fascinating details about their geological and geophysical properties, as well as their potential to harbor life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Experts say riding horses can be effective in gaining access to autistic children. Rowan Isaacson's language and temper improved with horse/shaman therapy. His parents never abandoned more orthodox treatments for Rowan's autism. Article:","output":"Title: A Family's Journey to Mongolia: How Horses and Shamanism Helped Their Autistic Son Introduction: When the Isaacson family found themselves seeking unconventional solutions to support their autistic son, Rowan, they embarked on an extraordinary journey across Mongolia - all in search of horseback riding and shamanic healing. Their quest was fueled by a desire for deeper connection and improved communication, as well as the knowledge that experts have found horse riding to be an effective method for gaining access to autistic children.  The Unconventional Treatment: For the Isaacson family, the decision to travel across Mongolia was not taken lightly. They were well aware of the significance of their autistic son's needs and were dedicated to exploring any viable options for his development. Their journey led them to a powerful combination of horse riding and meetings with shamans, which ultimately had a profound impact on Rowan's life. Despite their focus on these alternative approaches, Rowan's parents never left behind more orthodox treatments, ensuring that their son received a well-rounded and comprehensive care plan. The Therapeutic Power of Horse Riding: While horse riding might seem like an unusual therapy choice, countless experts support its benefits for autistic children. Engaging with horses allows children to develop vital skills through the gentle and non-judgmental interaction that these animals provide. This unique connection fosters a sense of self-awareness, as well as emotional and social growth, which can be challenging for autistic children to achieve through traditional methods. Rowan's Progress: Throughout the Isaacson's journey across Mongolia, they witnessed incredible progress in their son, who experienced significant improvements in both his language and temper. As a result of his time spent with horses and shamans, Rowan grew in ways his parents never imagined. They strongly believe that this unique combination was instrumental in unlocking the door to their son's development. Integrating Orthodox Treatments: While the Isaacsons were eager to explore unconventional treatments such as horse riding and shamanic therapy, they also understood the importance of integrating these alongside more traditional approaches. By maintaining a blend of methodologies, Rowan received a comprehensive and balanced treatment plan that nurtured his growth and development. Conclusion: The Isaacson family's journey across Mongolia is an inspiring story that reminds us of the extraordinary lengths parents may go to for their children. The unique blend of horse riding and shamanic healing provided Rowan with the opportunities to make remarkable progress in his overall development. This inspiring story serves as a powerful reminder that sometimes, unconventional methods may complement traditional treatments in helping children with autism reach milestones that were once considered out of reach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: hardware store, old clock, broom closet, puzzle, old houses  Why is \\"old clock\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Old clock\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the given question because of the context and clues provided in the question itself. The question describes a scenario involving an antique, a wooden rod falling out, and a component of chimes. By analyzing each possible answer and using human common sense, we can deduce which answer is the most appropriate. 1. Hardware store: While a hardware store may carry items to fix an antique, it is not the most fitting answer, as the question asks what is still functional after the wooden rod fell out. The hardware store is unrelated to the actual functioning of the object in question. 2. Old clock: When thinking of antiques that contain chimes and a potentially wooden rod, an old clock instantly comes to mind. Clocks are not only one of the most common antiques but also have chimes as an integral part of their functionality. Grandfather clocks, cuckoo clocks, and mantle clocks with chimes often have wooden components. Therefore, when a wooden rod connected to the chimes falls out of an antique, it is reasonable to assume that an old clock is still functional despite the dislodged rod. 3. Broom closet: This answer does not make much sense in the given context, as a broom closet is an unrelated object. It has no connection to the antique, the wooden rod, or the chimes mentioned in the question. 4. Puzzle: Though some antique puzzles could have a wooden construction, there is no obvious connection between a puzzle and chimes. Chimes are not a common feature of puzzles, and thus, this answer does not align well with human common sense. 5. Old houses: While old houses could have antique items with wooden rods and chimes, the answer is too general and does not directly address the specific functionality of the object. The question is asking about the functional aspect of an object rather than the location or context it is found in. In conclusion, \\"old clock\\" is the answer that best aligns with human common sense due to the direct association with the given context and clues in the question. The antique with a wooden rod and chimes suggests an object with a function related to those attributes, and an old clock fits that description most accurately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who gets fed on by someone with vampire fangs? is inside the article: Peter Loew is a driven literary agent and an example of the stereotypical narcissistic and greedy yuppie of the 1980s: he works all day and club hops at night, with little in his life but alcohol, one night stands and the pursuit of money and prestige. However, he is slowly going insane and sees a therapist frequently; it is during these sessions that his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants which eventually begin to scare even the psychiatrist. After he takes home a girl he met in a club named Jackie, a bat flies in through his window, scaring them both. At his next session he mentions to his therapist that the struggle with the bat aroused him, and after visiting an art museum with Jackie the next day, he ditches her, and she leaves an angry message on his phone. Loew meets Rachel at a night club, and takes her home. She pins him down, reveals vampire fangs and feeds on him. He soon begins to believe that he is changing into a vampire. He stares into a bathroom mirror and fails to see his reflection, he wears dark sunglasses during the day, and, when his \\"fangs\\" fail to develop, he purchases a pair of cheap plastic vampire teeth. All the while, Rachel visits him nightly to feed on his blood. Shortly after, Loew experiences mood swings and calls Jackie back apologetically, asking to meet her at a bar. As he is about to leave, a jealous Rachel appears and beckons him back inside. A dejected Jackie eventually leaves the bar and leaves an angry note on his door asking him to leave her alone., can you guess it ?

He says that \\"feathers help birds fly and provide insulation\\" and \\"penguins rely on their feathers for insulation\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What keeps penguins warm?\\" is that penguins rely on their specialized feathers for insulation to stay warm in the extreme cold environments they inhabit. These unique feathers play a crucial role in helping penguins maintain their body temperature and stay comfortable amidst harsh conditions like strong winds, cold temperatures, and frigid waters. Penguin feathers are specifically adapted to provide exceptional insulation, which is essential for the birds to thrive in their environments. Penguin feathers are quite different from those of most birds. They are short, dense, and posses a unique structure that makes them highly effective for retaining warmth. A penguin's feathers are closely packed together, and they interlock to create a thick and insulating layer that helps trap warm air close to the bird's body. This trapped air acts as a barrier against the cold and minimizes heat loss. In addition to this dense feather layer, penguins also possess a layer of downy feathers close to their skin. The downy feathers are soft and fluffy, providing another layer of insulation that prevents the cold from reaching the penguin's skin and maintains the heat generated by their bodies. Another essential aspect of penguin feathers is that they are highly waterproof. This characteristic is vital for penguins, as they spend a significant amount of time in the icy waters hunting for food. The waterproofing is achieved through the presence of special oils that penguins preen onto their feathers from a gland near the base of their tail. This helps to ensure that their feathers remain dry and continue to insulate even when they are submerged in cold waters. Moreover, penguins have the ability to control the depth of their insulation by adjusting the position of their feathers in response to the surrounding temperature. This is called piloerection, and it helps them maintain a steady body temperature by either trapping more air for additional insulation when it's colder or releasing some of the trapped air to cool down when it's warmer. In summary, the best answer to the question \\"What keeps penguins warm?\\" is that penguins rely heavily on their specialized feathers to provide insulation in their freezing environments. These feathers, combined with the bird's ability to adjust the depth of insulation, allow them to maintain their body temperature and thrive in extreme cold conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The Lib Dem minister has called for a rethink of plans to provide government guarantees for low-deposit mortgages beginning in January. He said there were already signs of \\"serious housing inflationary pressures\\" in parts of the country. But Downing Street said the plan would remove \\"obstacles\\" to aspiring buyers. The Help to Buy Scheme, announced in March's Budget, is designed to help first-time buyers get on the property ladder and enable existing homeowners to \\"trade up\\" to larger properties by giving banks greater confidence to lend. Under the second phase of the scheme, the government will guarantee a proportion of the loan for purchases of up to Â£600,000 for those able to put down a deposit of between 5% and 20%. The assistance, championed by Chancellor George Osborne, will be available for three years. Some economists have questioned whether such a major government intervention in the mortgage market - on top of existing equity loans for first-time buyers - is justified, saying it may lead to an unsustainable increase in prices. Recent indicators have suggested that prices are already increasing at their fastest rate for almost seven years - boosted by competitive mortgage rates and continuing imbalances of supply and demand. Mr Cable told Sky News that ministers should \\"certainly think about how it [Help to Buy] should come into effect, indeed whether it should come into effect in the light of changing market conditions\\". \\"We don't want a new housing bubble,\\" he added. \\"In many parts of the country it clearly isn't a problem. If you are in Northern Ireland or Wales or indeed the East Midlands you would wonder what all this is about,\\" \\"But certainly in London and the South East, in the north-east of Scotland, in other areas, there are serious housing inflationary pressures.\\" The chief executive of Barclays, Antony Jenkins, has said he is concerned about the potential for a \\"property-driven boom\\" and although the Bank of England is monitoring the state of the market carefully, \\"these things can be difficult to control\\". But No 10 said the scheme would go ahead as planned. \\"We are faced with a situation - because of the fall in availability of 90 to 95% loan-to-value mortgages - where many first-time buyers are faced with a real obstacle to making a home of their own,\\" a spokesman said. \\"It is important we address this issue.\\" In an upbeat speech on the economy earlier in the week, Mr Osborne said 95% mortgages were not \\"weapons of mass financial destruction\\" but legitimate products that enabled those who could not save enough for a larger deposit to buy a home. Mr Cable has suggested an \\"uncontrolled\\" rise in house prices is one of the risks to a sustainable long-term economic recovery but the Council of Mortgage Lenders has described the pace of housing activity - compared with pre-2007 boom levels - as \\"moderate\\". Speaking at a CBI conference at Warwick University on Wednesday, Mr Cable said there were clear signs the economy was beginning to pick up but the upturn would only be \\"meaningful\\" when business had the confidence to increase levels of investment. He also warned against complacency \\"generated by a few quarters of good economic data\\". The CBI's director general, John Cridland, said there was \\"gathering momentum\\" in the economy but more needed to be done to correct the \\"profound economic imbalances which built up during the boom years\\", including developing a \\"coherent\\" industrial strategy.","output":"A Lib Dem minister has called for a reevaluation of plans to provide government guarantees for low-deposit mortgages starting in January due to signs of \\"serious housing inflationary pressures\\" in parts of the UK.

Sometimes it is hard to look at a cause and find out what causes the effect. It may help you to start with the effect and use your reasoning  skills. Think about all the things you know that could be reasons for the effect you can see. For example, you may see someone putting on a heavy jacket. This is the effect. To look for a cause, think to yourself, \\"What would take someone put on a heavy jacket?\\" Maybe the person is going outside into very cold weather. Maybe the person works in the penguin pen  at Sea World. Maybe the person is going to visit an ice skating rink where the air is kept very cold. All of these things could be a cause for putting on a heavy jacket. Now, think about a second example. The effect is a boy named Abi has to go to the head teacher's office. What are the possible causes? Maybe he bullied  another student. Maybe he is just being picked up early. Maybe he is being given a prize! Here is another example for you to think about its cause and effect. Cait, 13, was trying to fall asleep when her 8-year-old brother, Doug, came into her room. He looked around a bit, but seemed really out of it. Then Doug went back into the hallway and stood there looking straight up at the hall light for quite a while. Little brothers can be very strange, but this was really much too strange. Cait's father appeared and explained that Doug was sleepwalking. What's the cause end effect, could you tell? ,. Question: What was Doug doing when his sister Cait tried to fall asleep? - He was going outside. - He was reading a story. - He was sleepwalking. - He was looking for his dad. The answer to this question is:","output":"He was sleepwalking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Write an article based on this summary: A railway that was dormant for 50 years has reopened after more than 200 community volunteers spent eight years restoring it.","output":"Title: Reviving History: Community Volunteers Bring Dormant Railway Back to Life after 50 Years Introduction History has been brought back to life as a railway that remained dormant for 50 years is now up and running again, all thanks to the dedication and hard work of more than 200 community volunteers who spent eight long years restoring it. This remarkable example of community spirit demonstrates how collective efforts can contribute to a significant achievement that benefits the entire community.  Step 1: The Beginning of the Restoration Project The journey of this historic railway's revival started eight years ago when a group of passionate volunteers recognized the potential of the disused railway. Upon seeing the sorry state of the railway, overgrown with vegetation and in disrepair, the volunteers felt that restoring it would not only preserve a piece of history but also provide numerous benefits to the community. Step 2: Gathering Support and Resources With the initial idea of restoring the railway in place, the group of volunteers set out to garner support from the local community. They organized meetings, events, and fundraisers to raise awareness about the project. Through persistent efforts, the group members succeeded in gathering the needed resources and increasing the number of volunteers willing to lend a hand, bringing the overall count to over 200. Step 3: Assessing Requirements and Formulating a Plan The next step involved assessing the restoration requirements of the railway. The volunteers conducted a thorough examination of the tracks, bridges, stations, and other infrastructure elements. This assessment helped them understand the extent of the work needed and formulate a comprehensive plan that highlighted the tasks required, their estimated time frames, and potential budgetary constraints. Step 4: The Restoration Process With the plan in hand, the volunteers set to work on the restoration process. This undertaking involved clearing away vegetation, repairing or replacing tracks, fixing bridges, renovating railway stations, and refitting electrical systems. The skillful work of the volunteers spanned many professions, including carpenters, electricians, and engineers. Over the course of eight years, the hardworking volunteers devoted their spare time to bring the railway back to life. Step 5: Testing and Formal Reopening Once the restoration work was complete, the railway underwent a series of safety tests to ensure its functionality and compliance with regulations. Upon successful completion of the tests, the long-dormant railway finally reopened for public use amidst great fanfare. The volunteers celebrated their remarkable achievement with the community, who were excited to witness a piece of history come back to life. Conclusion The revitalization of this long-dormant railway stands as a testament to the power of community spirit, dedication, and hard work. The collective efforts of more than 200 volunteers have transformed a neglected piece of history into a fully-functioning railway that now benefits the local community. This inspiring story serves as a reminder that, when united in a common cause, anything is possible."},{"instruction":"Question: Title: beautiful night under the stars/ceiling :) Review: the size of the star are great not to big not to small the adhesive stickers could've been better but will do they dont glow very long but if you use a black light they glow all night i have them in my room and when i watch movies with my girl or friends its great i turn off the lights and turn on the black light and the stars are beautiful its like being at a drive thru people are looking at the stars more then the movie try a black light it works :) Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of person whose ancestral home was denied to her through agnatic primogeniture?  Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's \\"one magnificent act of creation\\".

Question: When was the Balfour Declaration issued?

Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"While the Balfour Declaration you mentioned refers to the development of the British Empire's relationship with its Dominions, it is important to note that the task refers to a separate Balfour Declaration. The Balfour Declaration in your question clashing refers to a public statement issued by the British government during World War I announcing support for the establishment of a \\"national home for the Jewish people\\" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a minority Jewish population. It was dated 2 November 1917. The declaration was contained in a letter from the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. This declaration was significant because it represented one of the first instances in which a major world power supported Zionist goals. The reasons behind the issuance of the Balfour Declaration are multifarious and complex. Firstly, Britain’s primary motivation was rooted in its own strategic interests. During the First World War, Britain was in dire need of Jewish support - specifically American Jewish backing - to strengthen its efforts against Germany and its allies. By endorsing the Zionist cause, Britain hoped to secure this much-needed support. Secondly, many in the British government, including Balfour himself, were influenced by their Christian upbringing with its underlying Zionist tenets. There was a romanticized conception of bringing the Jewish people back to the biblical homeland. Finally, there were internal political calculations. At the time, Zionist ideals were popular among some sections of the British Liberal party, with which Balfour was affiliated. They believed that a Jewish state would help ensure that the area remained pro-British. The Balfour Declaration had far-reaching implications. It engendered substantial immigration of Jews to Palestine and is considered one of the main catalysts of the eventual establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Despite initiating a monumental shift for the Jewish diaspora, it simultaneously became a source of ongoing contention with the Arab population in Palestine, laying grounds for a century-long conflict in the region. The Balfour Declaration, therefore, holds a critical place in the annals of Middle East history. It has proved to be one of the most contentious and controversial documents in the recent history of the world, promising a homeland for one people at the expense of another already living there, hence contributing to a long, ongoing conflict that remains unresolved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ABC Familyâs âBunheadsâ Season Ends With No Word on Renewal âBunheadsâ stars Sutton Foster, center, who has made the transition to television lead. As the end of the television season approaches, and odds are laid on the survival of prominent shows like “Smash” and “The Good Wife,” a handful of us are asking: What about “Bunheads”? This bittersweet comedy from Amy Sherman-Palladino about life and dance in the California hills lost about 40 percent of its audience over the course of its first season, which ended Feb. 25, and ABC Family has not announced whether it will be renewed. For the one million people who watched the finale Sutton Foster and Bailey Buntain may forever be sitting on a bench, wondering if the boy Ms. Buntain’s character slept with will ever call her back. That would be unfortunate, because “Bunheads,” beyond being a charming and funny show, has the great merit of being unlike anything else on television at the moment. It doesn’t fit into any of the typical prime-time genres, though it has affinities with teenage comedy and family drama. It could also be grouped, very loosely, with the music show “Glee” and the theater show “Smash,” except that “Bunheads” gets at what performance really means in its characters’ lives rather than using it as a kind of artificial sweetener to stimulate the fantasies of the audience. The show isn’t sui generis; its predecessors include Ms. Sherman-Palladino’s “Gilmore Girls” and other category-resistant shows like “Northern Exposure” and “Picket Fences.” But as a serious, literate, hourlong comedy it will always be a rare breed. (And it is a comedy, in the classical sense, not a comic drama or, ugh, dramedy.) Ms. Sherman-Palladino’s hyperverbal, screwball style and amusingly neurotic characters seem to be drawn less from television history than from John Hughes, Woody Allen and Jane Austen. “Bunheads” started with an audaciously arbitrary plot twist. The sassy and cynical Las Vegas showgirl Michelle Simms (Ms. Foster), blind drunk after a pity date with a nerdy admirer, Hubbell (Alan Ruck), woke up married to him. (That wasn’t the twist.) After Michelle saw Hubbell’s idyllic but rustic hometown, named Paradise, and met his formidable mother, Fanny (Kelly Bishop), logic dictated that she would high-tail it back to Vegas. So Ms. Sherman-Palladino killed off Hubbell in the first episode, stranding Michelle in Paradise and saddling her with enough guilt and responsibility to make it mildly plausible when she stayed to help at Fanny’s dance studio. Hubbell’s death was a clever device but also, through the first two episodes, a downer. That might help explain why the audience started to slip away even as the show shifted into more of a high-comic gear, and the focus quickly moved from Michelle’s angst — 30-something former dance prodigy still yearning for the bright lights of Broadway — to her relationship with four precocious ballet students, the bunheads of the title, who function as her fan club, her younger selves and her comic chorus line. Another problem early on was Ms. Foster, who wasn’t immediately successful in the transition from Tony-winning Broadway musical star (“Thoroughly Modern Millie” and “Anything Goes”) to TV lead. She seemed to scale herself down too far, as if afraid of making Michelle a stereotypical wisecracking chorine, and made her an uncomfortable noodge. That was fixed. The character seemed to be tweaked to fit with Ms. Foster’s low-key style, and for most of the season “Bunheads” was in a groove. It hasn’t been extraordinary, perhaps, but it’s been unusually smart, stylish and well acted, with winning performances by Ms. Bishop (a “Gilmore Girls” alumna) and the bunheads (Ms. Buntain, Kaitlyn Jenkins, Julia Goldani Telles and the swanishly gawky Emma Dumont) as well as Stacey Oristano and another “Gilmore” alum, Liza Weil, as the hilariously mismatched Stone sisters. In a Sherman-Palladino trademark all the characters take turns being the adult, in a way that reflects the insecurities and fulfills the wishes of real life: the teenagers tend to be focused and mature, while the actual adults are more likely to be scattered and irresponsible. The bunheads take care of one another, though in a crunch it’s Michelle’s shoulder they prefer to cry on. The season finale was a representative episode, with some story lines that were just O.K. — a scene with Franny insisting on giving the bunheads a sex-ed lecture wasn’t as funny as you’d expect — and a 12-minute sequence that was as good as anything I’ve seen on TV this year. In it Michelle sneaked off to Los Angeles to audition for a Broadway-bound musical alongside hundreds of other hopefuls while a casting director dismissed them at a machine-gun pace: “Nope. Nope. Nope.” It felt sadly, hopelessly real, and it epitomized Ms. Sherman-Palladino and Ms. Foster’s ability to render the texture of the performer’s life. That also shows up, in a different style, in the dance numbers that satirize and celebrate the sort of amateur performances many of us have endured, while illuminating the characters’ emotions and aspirations. The kicker to Michelle’s audition (the show had already been cast) could be seen as a cop-out; if the central conflict is between her Broadway dreams and her attachment to Paradise, then she needs to be faced with a real choice. But I’d be happy to let that wait until Season 2. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"\\"Bunheads,\\" a bittersweet comedy from Amy Sherman-Palladino about life and dance in the California hills, lost about 40% of its audience over the course of its first season which ended on February 25, and ABC Family has not announced whether it will be renewed.

East region had an alpine landscape, was situated in the mountains. North region was flat and located at sea level.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which region didn't have a colder climate?  Hint: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.

Problem:Context: To determine in a Phase I study the maximum tolerated dose of weekly gemcitabine concurrent with radiotherapy in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as the relationship between the volume of the esophagus irradiated and severe esophagitis.', 'Twenty-one patients with Stage III NSCLC received gemcitabine initially at 150 mg/m(2)/wk over 7 weeks concurrently with chest radiotherapy to 63 Gy in 34 fractions. The first 9 patients underwent treatment with two-dimensional (2D) radiotherapy; the remaining 12 patients, with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and target volume reduced to clinically apparent disease. Consolidation was 4 cycles of gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m(2)/wk and cisplatin 60 mg/m(2).', 'In the 2D group, the dose-limiting toxicity, Grade 3 esophagitis, occurred in 3 of 6 patients in the 150-mg/m(2)/wk cohort and 2 of 3 patients in the 125-mg/m(2)/wk cohort. No cases of Grade 3 esophagitis occurred at these doses in the 3D group. At gemcitabine 190 mg/m(2)/wk, 2 of 6 patients in the 3D cohort had Grade 3 esophagitis. The mean percentages of esophagus irradiated to 60 Gy were 68% in the 2D cohort and 18% in the 3D cohort.Question: Is dose escalation of gemcitabine possible with concurrent chest three-dimensional rather than two-dimensional radiotherapy : a phase I trial in patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer? Solution:","output":"Yes, dose escalation of gemcitabine is possible with concurrent chest three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy (CRT) rather than two-dimensional (2D) radiotherapy in a Phase I trial for patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the study, 21 patients with Stage III NSCLC received gemcitabine initially at 150 mg/m²/week over 7 weeks concurrently with chest radiotherapy to 63 Gy in 34 fractions. The first 9 patients underwent treatment with 2D radiotherapy, while the remaining 12 patients received 3D-CRT with target volume reduced to clinically apparent disease. In the 2D group, Grade 3 esophagitis, which was the dose-limiting toxicity, occurred in 3 out of 6 patients in the 150-mg/m²/week cohort and 2 out of 3 patients in the 125-mg/m²/week cohort. In contrast, no cases of Grade 3 esophagitis occurred at these doses in the 3D group. At gemcitabine 190 mg/m²/week, 2 of 6 patients in the 3D cohort experienced Grade 3 esophagitis. The mean percentages of esophagus irradiated to 60 Gy were 68% in the 2D cohort and 18% in the 3D cohort.

It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records.

Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head, the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain. With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels, a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum, Eastbourne was developed by the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets. It has a growing population, a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries.  - Alfriston is a village and civil parish in the Sussex district of Wealden , England . The village lies in the valley of the River Cuckmere , about four miles ( 6 km ) north - east of Seaford and south of the main A27 trunk road and part of the large area of Polegate . The parish has a population of 769 ( 2001 census ) , increasing to 829 at the 2011 census .  - Polegate is a town and civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex, England, United Kingdom. It is located five miles (8 km) north of the seaside resort of Eastbourne, and is part of the greater area of that town. Although once a railway settlement, its importance as such has now waned with closures of routes. The parish of Polegate had a population of 8586 on the 2011 census of which 41.2% were aged 65 and over.  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish.  - The River Cuckmere rises near Heathfield in East Sussex, England on the southern slopes of the Weald. The name of the river probably comes from an Old English word meaning \\"fast-flowing\\", since it descends over 100 m (328 ft) in its initial four miles (6.4 km). It flows into the English Channel, and has the only undeveloped river mouth on the Sussex coast.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - The Weald is an area in South East England situated between the parallel chalk escarpments of the North and the South Downs. It crosses the counties of Sussex, Hampshire, Kent and Surrey. It has three separate parts: the sandstone \\"High Weald\\" in the centre; the clay \\"Low Weald\\" periphery; and the Greensand Ridge, which stretches around the north and west of the Weald and includes its highest points. The Weald once was covered with forest, and its name, Old English in origin, signifies \\"woodland.\\" The term is still used today, as scattered farms and villages sometimes refer to the Weald in their names.  - East Sussex is a county in South East England. It is bordered by the counties of Kent to the north and east, Surrey to the north west and West Sussex to the west, and to the south by the English Channel.  - A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government.  - Wealden is a local government district in East Sussex, England: its name comes from the Weald, the remnant forest which was once unbroken and occupies much of the centre and north of this area. The term is cognate with \\"Wald\\", forest or wood in German.

A Beijing-based company named Innofidei Inc. claims to have developed the first mobile TV chip for the market, which can change hundreds of thousands of mobiles into micro-TVs. With this chip, people can receive TV signals on their phones and watch programs without any time or space limitations.\\"As long as the handset terminal  has a colored screen and a battery, our chip can turn it into a mobile TV,\\" said Meng Fei, director of Innofidei's business development department. The chip can be placed into a cell phone, a PDA, an MP4, a digital camera or even a laptop. He said that this, together with plans by China's state broadcaster, would ensure the 2008 Games lives up to its promise as a \\"People's Olympics\\". \\"Our chips are cheap so that cell phones with them will not be much different in price from regular phones,\\" Meng said. \\"CCTV will offer some free channels during the Games, so people can enjoy the Olympics for free.\\" SARFT  is planning to build a regional test network in Beijing and hopes to start trials as soon as possible. The goal is to deploy CMMB   on a national level by the first half of 2008. Innofidei is now busy selling their chips to cell phone makers so that the new generation of phones reaches the market in early 2008. \\"Our invention successfully combines the good points of the two best-selling consumer products in history--TV sets and cell phones, \\" said Meng. \\"In the near future, soccer fans won't be tearing their hair out because they are stuck in traffic and missing the chance to see their favorite team's play.\\" Local baseball fans, meanwhile, will be able to draw comfort from the knowledge that--both at the Olympics and afterwards--their teams will be playing on a field designed to help recycle water.

Question: Question: \\"Who is supposed by a religious scholar of the time to place themselves in the position of god?\\"  Context: \\"A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context of Enlightenment and the various religious perspectives that emerged during this era, the religious scholar's statement seems to refer to individuals who deny the existence of a higher power or divine law and rely solely on their own judgment and reasoning. Such individuals are believed to place themselves in the position of god, as they dismiss any higher authority beyond their own understanding and will. During the Enlightenment, various perspectives competed for intellectual acceptance, such as skepticism, deism, vitalism, pantheism, and atheism. While few intellectuals were true atheists, many challenged the prevailing orthodox beliefs and championed alternative religious outlooks. Deism, for instance, focused on the belief in God as the Creator without reliance on the Bible or any other miraculous source, prioritizing personal reason as the guiding force for their beliefs. This idea was particularly appealing to many Enlightenment thinkers who emphasized reason and rationality. Some intellectuals, like Pierre Bayle, argued that atheists could still be moral individuals despite their lack of belief in a god who punishes evil. They believed that atheists could hold concepts of honor and contribute positively to society, going beyond their own self-interest. However, critics like Voltaire maintained that without the belief in a higher authority, the moral order of society would be compromised. Concerns about the impact of atheistic beliefs on societal stability stemmed from the fear that, without divine law or a Supreme Authority, there would be no guiding principles for behavior and morality. Locke, for example, argued that in the absence of a god or divine law, individuals \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself.\\" Consequently, such individuals would have nothing to restrain their actions or guide their moral compass, thus leading to moral anarchy. In this light, the religious scholar's remark on individuals placing themselves in the position of god appears to address the potential consequences of rejecting divine authority and relying solely on one's own judgment. By doing so, they disregard any external moral standards or laws, and in effect, assume a god-like authority over their actions. This perspective raises concerns about the impact of such beliefs on society, with critics arguing that the absence of divine guidance might undermine the moral fabric of society and lead to chaos and instability. On the other hand, some argue that it is possible for such individuals to develop their own moral frameworks and contribute positively to society without appealing to higher powers. The debate surrounding these issues reflects the complex religious dynamics during the Enlightenment, with intellectuals challenging the influence of orthodox religious beliefs on society while also trying to understand the role of religion and morality in structuring social order."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Simon & Garfunkel were an American folk rock duo consisting of singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel. They were one of the best-selling music groups of the 1960s and became counterculture icons of the decade's social revolution, alongside artists such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan. Their biggest hits--including \\"The Sound of Silence\\" (1964), \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" (1968), \\"The Boxer\\" (1969), and \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" (1970)--reached number one on singles charts worldwide. Their often rocky relationship led to artistic disagreements, which resulted in their breakup in 1970. The duo's fourth studio album, Bookends, was recorded in fits and starts over various periods from late 1966 to early 1968. The duo were signed under an older contract that specified the label pay for sessions, and Simon & Garfunkel took advantage of this indulgence, hiring viola and brass players, as well as percussionists. The record's brevity reflects its concise and perfectionist production. The team spent over 50 studio hours recording \\"Punky's Dilemma\\", for example, and re-recorded vocal parts, sometimes note by note, until they were satisfied. Garfunkel's songs and voice took a lead role on some of the songs, and the harmonies for which the duo was known gradually disappeared. For Simon, Bookends represented the end of the collaboration and became an early indicator of his intentions to go solo. Although the album had been planned long in advance, work did not begin in earnest until the late months of 1967.  Prior to release, the band helped put together and performed at the Monterey Pop Festival, which signaled the beginning of the Summer of Love on the West Coast. \\"Fakin' It\\" was issued as a single that summer and found only modest success on AM radio; the duo were much more focused on the rising FM format, which played album cuts and treated their music with respect. In January 1968, the duo appeared on a Kraft Music Hall special, Three for Tonight, performing ten songs largely culled from their third album. Bookends was released by Columbia Records in April 1968. In an historical context, this was just 24 hours before the assassination of civil rights movement activist Martin Luther King Jr., which spurred nationwide outrage and riots. The album debuted on the Billboard Top LPs in the issue dated April 27, 1968, climbing to number one and staying at that position for seven non-consecutive weeks; it remained on the chart as a whole for 66 weeks. Bookends received such heavy orders weeks in advance of its release that Columbia was able to apply for award certification before copies left the warehouse, a fact it touted in magazine ads. The record became the duo's best-selling album to date: it fed off the buzz created by the release of The Graduate soundtrack album ten weeks earlier, creating an initial combined sales figure of over five million units.  Davis had predicted this fact, and suggested raising the list price of Bookends by one dollar to 5.79, above the then standard retail price, to compensate for including a large poster included in vinyl copies. Simon instead scoffed and viewed it as charging a premium on \\"what was sure to be that year's best-selling Columbia album\\". According to biographer Marc Eliot, Davis was \\"offended by what he perceived as their lack of gratitude for what he believed was his role in turning them into superstars\\". Rather than implement Davis' price increase plan, Simon & Garfunkel signed a contract extension with Columbia that guaranteed them a higher royalty rate. The lead single \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" became, at the 1969 Grammy Awards the first rock and roll song to receive Record of the Year; it was also awarded Best Contemporary Pop Performance by a Duo or Group.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: did they record any other albums in the studio?","output":"From the provided text: \\"The duo's fourth studio album, Bookends, was recorded in fits and starts over various periods from late 1966 to early 1968.\\" This quote indicates that there were prior studio albums, as Bookends was their fourth studio album, implying that they have recorded at least three other studio albums before this one."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in Spanish and your task is to translate it into English.

Given the question: Process:  - You inhale - Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled - You start the process over again.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no air in the lung happens, how will it affect air is cleared in the lung.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having no air in the lungs would have a direct effect on the process of air clearing within the lungs. The entire process of respiration is predicated upon the presence and exchange of air (oxygen and carbon dioxide) within the lungs. Let's examine this situation in greater detail. First, let's recap the normal process of respiration: 1. Inhalation: You inhale, which involves drawing air into your lungs. This is facilitated by the downward movement of the diaphragm and the expansion of the chest cavity. 2. Lung expansion and filling: As the diaphragm moves down, the lungs have more room to expand, and air fills the lungs. The inhaled air contains oxygen, which is necessary for survival. 3. Exhalation: After a short duration, you exhale, at which point the diaphragm moves back up and reduces the volume of your chest cavity. During this process, carbon dioxide, a waste product from cellular respiration, is expelled from the lungs. 4. Repeating the process: The process starts over again as you continue to inhale and exhale. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis – the complete absence of air within the lungs. Under this circumstance, several consequences would arise, directly affecting the normal process of respiration and gas exchange within the body: 1. Difficulty in inhaling: With no air in the lungs, it might be challenging to draw air into them due to the vacuum effect generated by the emptiness. This could further lead to strain on the diaphragm and respiratory muscles as they work harder to overcome the vacuum pressure. 2. Disruption of gas exchange: The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and the bloodstream. Oxygen is vital for cell function and overall survival, while carbon dioxide is a waste product that needs to be removed from the body. No air in the lungs would mean that the necessary gas exchange would not occur, leading to oxygen deprivation and an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the body. 3. Potential damage to lung tissue: The absence of air in the lungs can also cause the delicate lung tissue to collapse, as the alveoli, which are tiny sacs responsible for gas exchange, rely on air to maintain their structure. Collapsed alveoli can lead to lung damage and decreased lung capacity, further impacting the efficiency of gas exchange. 4. Systemic effects: If the absence of air in the lungs persists, it can lead to a severe reduction in oxygen levels and a dangerous increase in carbon dioxide levels in the body, causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, confusion, and eventually leading to unconsciousness and death, if not addressed. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis stating the absence of air in the lungs would have a direct effect on the process of air being cleared in the lungs as well as having systemic implications on the body's overall function. The normal process of respiration is critical for maintaining adequate oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the body, and any disruption to this process may lead to detrimental health consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1898, a large plot of land was sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. for the construction of 1,200 houses. The houses were never built, but the land later became the site of Trafford Park Village, known locally as The Village. The announced arrival of the Westinghouse factory acted a spur to development, and in 1899, Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd was formed, with the aim of providing housing for the anticipated influx of new workers. Nuttall's land was acquired, and by 1903 more than 500 houses had been built, rising to over 700 when the development was completed in 1904. In 1907 it was estimated that the population of the Village was 3,060. The development was laid out in a grid pattern, with the roads numbered instead of being named. Avenues numbered 1 to 4 run north–south, streets numbered 1 to 12 run east–west. The Village was almost completely self-contained, with its own shops, public hall, post office, police station, school, social club, and sports facilities. Three corrugated iron churches were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts (Church of England) in 1902, and the Roman Catholic St Antony's in 1904. St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982. Only St Antony's remains open; it contains the altar and a stained glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford. The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; the streets were narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development was close to the pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as slums in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298 houses were demolished. A further 325 houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84 houses remaining.

Question: \\"What partial definition was created by Nakdong?\\"  Context: \\"By August, the KPA had pushed back the ROK Army and the Eighth United States Army to the vicinity of Pusan in southeast Korea. In their southward advance, the KPA purged the Republic of Korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals. On 20 August, General MacArthur warned North Korean leader Kim Il-sung that he was responsible for the KPA's atrocities. By September, the UN Command controlled the Pusan perimeter, enclosing about 10% of Korea, in a line partially defined by the Nakdong River.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The partial definition created by the Nakdong River refers to the natural boundary formed by the river, which contributed to the delimitation of the Pusan Perimeter during the Korean War. This geographical feature played a significant role in the defensive strategy of the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army and the United Nations Command led by the Eighth United States Army during their stand against the advancing North Korean People's Army (KPA) in August and September 1950. The Pusan Perimeter was a defensive line that encompassed the southeastern region of the Korean Peninsula, where the ROK Army and the UN Command managed to maintain control over approximately 10% of Korea. This line was essential for the survival and eventual counterattack of the allied forces since Pusan, the area's main port city, served as a crucial logistics and supply hub during the conflict. The Nakdong River, a major river in South Korea, emerges as an important natural barrier in this context because it provided a defensible line for the ROK Army and the UN Command, protecting the Pusan Perimeter from the southward advance of the KPA. The river's presence allowed the defending forces to establish a strong frontline based on its geographical features, which included steep banks, tight bends, and limited crossing points. Despite the challenging conditions, the KPA repeatedly attempted to breach the Nakdong River line and break through into the Pusan Perimeter. These efforts led to several significant confrontations, such as the Battle of Taegu and the Battle of the Naktong Bulge, both of which resulted in the successful defense by the ROK Army and UN Command and the subsequent failure of the KPA's offensives. In conclusion, the partial definition created by the Nakdong River refers to its role in shaping the Pusan Perimeter and providing a vital natural defensive barrier for the ROK Army and the UN Command during their battle against the KPA in the early stages of the Korean War. This natural boundary significantly influenced the strategic planning and defensive measures adopted by the allied forces and served as a contributing factor in their eventual ability to halt the KPA's southward advance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  Now, I have a new situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  Answer this question please: In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania? Answer:","output":"In comparing the two regions, plant roots would play a greater role in soil development in the Kenyan grasslands than in the Tanzanian forests. There are several factors that contribute to this difference, including the types of plant species present, the role of fires in grassland ecosystems, and the overall soil composition. In grassland ecosystems, like those found in Kenya, the deep, fibrous root systems of grasses play a crucial role in adding organic matter to the soil. These roots grow extensively both vertically and laterally, creating a dense network that holds the soil together and helps to prevent erosion. As the roots die and decompose, they contribute large amounts of organic matter to the soil, resulting in the development of a thick A horizon with a deep distribution of organic matter. In addition, fires are a frequent occurrence in grassland ecosystems, and although they may destroy aboveground plant material, they also stimulate increased contributions from roots. This is because the fires remove the aboveground biomass, freeing up space and nutrients which then encourages root growth. The ash from the burned vegetation also adds nutrients to the soil, further promoting root growth and soil development. By contrast, in the Tanzanian forests, tree leaves falling on the forest floor serve as the primary source of soil organic matter. Although the roots of trees also contribute to soil organic matter, this contribution is generally less significant than that of grass roots in grassland ecosystems. The soil in forests is characterized by a more layered structure, with most of the organic matter stored in the forest floor (O horizon) and a thinner A horizon. Moreover, the acidity in forest soils inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that would otherwise mix surface litter into the mineral soil, resulting in a thinner incorporation of organic matter in the A horizon of forest soils compared to grassland soils. In conclusion, plant roots play a greater role in soil development in the Kenyan grasslands due to the extensive root systems of grasses, their adaptation to the natural fire regime, and the deeper distribution of organic matter in grassland soils. The Tanzanian forests, while also contributing through root systems, rely more heavily on the accumulation of leaf litter on the forest floor for organic matter input and have a typically thinner A horizon and higher soil acidity which influences root growth and the activities of soil organisms."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

The body of Titus Tackett was found inside of a minivan about 11am this morning.      The minivan was parked outside of a home off Highway 72, the body was found by a resident. Tackett disappeared between about midnight and 1:15am on Wednesday morning from a home near Lake Killarney in the Killarney Shores area. That\`s about four miles southeast of Ironton.      A massive search started after Titus\` family discovered he had disappeared and called authorities.      Titus' aunt tells FOX 2 that Titus lived in Potosi with his mother and her parents. His mom brought him to his dad\`s home Tuesday night to visit his father and his sister. Titus\` father lives in Killarney Shores with his father and his daughter.      At about midnight Titus\` mom and dad went into Ironton and left Titus with his grandfather at the home. When they got back about 1:15am this morning, they noticed the door to the home was open and Titus was gone. That was when the search started.      Law officers from the Iron County Sheriff\`s Department, the Missouri Highway Patrol and the FBI searched all night into this morning. They searched by air and on the ground. K-9 searchers were also brought in.      Volunteers showed up as well- they walked the area and rode ATV\`s. That search went on until the tragic discovery was made inside the minivan.

Lee was a kind-hearted girl who always loved helping others and had a zest for learning new things. One evening, Lee came across a documentary on her town's local history showcasing their beautiful park and its lush green gardens. She was intrigued to discover that the park was actually established by the town's founding fathers, who wanted to promote relaxation and clean air for its residents. The park had been well kept for generations and had become a symbol of the town's pride. The following weekend, Lee and her mom visited the park, marveling at the vibrant flowers, tall trees, and happy people enjoying their leisure time with friends and family. Lee couldn't help but notice an elderly woman sitting alone on a bench, her eyes glazed over as if she was lost in deep thought. Sensing that the woman might be feeling lonely, Lee decided to approach her. \\"Excuse me, ma'am, would you like some company?\\" Lee asked gently. The woman looked up and a smile slowly formed on her face. \\"Why, yes, young lady. Please, sit down and join me.\\" As they talked, Lee discovered that the woman, Mrs. Thompson, was a descendant of one of the town's founding fathers. Unfortunately, Mrs. Thompson had no family left and had begun to feel a sense of sadness and loneliness despite the park's beautiful surroundings. Feeling her heart go out to the kind but lonely woman, Lee decided that she would do something special to make Mrs. Thompson feel more connected to the town and its people. Over the next few weeks, Lee did extensive research on the town's history and gathered several interesting stories interwoven with Mrs. Thompson's ancestors. One sunny day, she invited Mrs. Thompson to a picnic she had organized in the park. To Mrs. Thompson's surprise, the park was filled with families all having picnics, everyone chatting and enjoying the lovely day. It was as if the park had returned to its original purpose of fostering a sense of community and togetherness. With Mrs. Thompson in the center of it all, Lee began to tell the stories she had uncovered about the town's founding fathers. Each story resonated deeply with the townspeople, and the atmosphere grew vibrant and warm. Mrs. Thompson's eyes twinkled as she listened, grateful for Lee's efforts to bring connection and life back to the park. As the day came to an end and the families said their goodbyes, Mrs. Thompson hugged Lee tightly. \\"Thank you, dear. You've made this park, and my heart, feel alive again.\\" Returning home, Lee's mom couldn't help but gaze at her little girl with admiration and love. \\"Today, you did something truly special, sweetheart,\\" she said, with tears welling up in her eyes. And right there, as the sun set on the horizon, Lee's mom was proud of her daughter for being so thoughtful."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The original statement, \\"I sat there feeling rather like a chappie I'd once read about in a book, who murdered another cove and hid the body under the dining-room table, and then had to be the life and soul of a dinner party, with it there all the time.\\", describes a situation where the narrator is feeling similar to a character they had read about in a book.

Four nights later they saw the thief. All the police officers rushed to grab the guy and they caught him. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\" All the police officers rushed to grab the guy and it took them 20 minutes to catch him.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot conclusively say that \\"It took the police officers 20 minutes to catch the thief.\\"  The paragraph clearly states that the police officers were staking the area for several nights in an attempt to catch the thief. It is evident that they had devoted a significant amount of time to this operation, however, there is no information given about the duration of the chase once the thief was spotted.  The actions during the specific event of the thief being spotted and subsequently caught are described in relatively brief terms, 'they saw the thief', followed immediately by 'all the police officers rushed to grab the guy and they caught him.' There is no explicit mention of the time it took from the moment they saw the thief to the moment they apprehended him.  Without this specific information, it would be impossible to confirm whether it took them 20 minutes to apprehend the thief during that particular incident. Hypothetically, the capture could have been instantaneous, without any chase at all, or it could have spanned a much longer period than the suggested 20 minutes.  To be able to confidently conclude the duration of the capture, we would need additional information describing the event in more detail. For instance, it would be pertinent to know whether there was a chase, if so, how long it lasted, how far they had to run, or if there were other factors that could have prolonged the period before the thief was finally apprehended. Lacking such specifics, any assertion about the time taken for the actual capture would be conjectural at best. Thus, the statement \\"All the police officers rushed to grab the guy and it took them 20 minutes to catch him.\\" cannot be validated based on the information provided in the paragraph."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Judge denies request to delay Boston Marathon bombing trial due to Paris attacks The judge overseeing the Boston Marathon bombing trial on Wednesday denied a request from the alleged bomber’s attorneys to delay the trial due to the recent attacks in France. Lawyers for Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev had asked the judge to delay jury selection due to the violence in France, which has dominated the news over the last week and drawn comparisons to what unfolded in Boston two years ago. The shooting massacre at the office of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper in Paris, was followed by a massive manhunt for two brothers who authorities said had become radicalized; days of bloodshed and panic culminated in a shootout with police. News reports and commentators have repeatedly pointed to how this mirrored much of what happened when the Boston Marathon was bombed, an attack that killed three people and injured more than 260 others in April 2013. Within days, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, were the subjects of a manhunt that reverberated across a major metropolitan area; the brothers, who law enforcement officials said had become radicalized, engaged in a shootout with police before Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed and his younger brother eventually taken into custody. Attorneys for Tsnarnaev argued that while the massive pool of jurors was instructed to avoid news about the Boston Marathon bombing trial, they were not told to avoid news from France, which meant they could have been exposed to the reports tying the two situations together. District Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. rejected the request Wednesday, saying that the detailed questionnaires filled out by potential jurors confirmed his judgment that a fair and impartial jury could be found: This is the latest time O’Toole has rejected requests from Tsarnaev’s attorneys arguing that the trial be postponed. He has done so at least twice and has also denied requests that the trial be moved to a different location, determining that a fair jury could be found. O’Toole, a Massachusetts native who was appointed in 1995, is said to have a calm, collected temperament. “He has that unique way of detaching himself, to be absolutely objective, which I think is a great skill,” Jim McIntyre, who recruited O’Toole to Boston College, told the Boston Globe last month. While he has repeatedly turned down requests to delay or move the trial, he has also suggested that he is keeping an open mind and said he would revisit these issues based on what happens during jury selection. Jury selection in the high-profile trial began last week. Tsarnaev faces 30 charges for the attack and for shooting and killing Sean Collier, an MIT campus police officer, in the days after the bombing. About 1,200 potential jurors are being considered for the trial, which is expected to begin on Jan. 26 and could last for up to four months. The jury pool is so large because of the nature of this case. In addition to finding jurors in the region who can be deemed impartial, there needs to be 18 potential jurors — a dozen to sit on the jury and six alternates — who are willing to give Tsarnaev the death penalty. The Justice Department is seeking the death penalty in this case, which makes for an unusual situation in Massachusetts, a state that abolished the death penalty in 1984. A Boston Globe poll conducted five months after the bombing showed that 57 percent of people in Massachusetts wanted Tsarnaev to serve a life sentence, compared to 33 percent who wanted the death penalty.

Article: The creative projects of World Food Program (WFP) focused on preventing hunger from taking hold in the future and breaking the cycle of hunger. Here are some of the ways in which we work to prevent hunger in the future: School Meals As well as directly addressing hunger, School Meals projects encourage families to keep their children in school and help them build better futures. If children aren't hungry they will concentrate on their lessons. With a solid education growing children have a better chance of finding their own way out of hunger. These projects benefit girls especially. For more information: www.wfp.org/schools meals. Food for Assets  WFP's Food for Assets projects provide the hungry with food to lay the foundation for a better tomorrow. When poor farmers no longer have to worry about the next meal, they have the time and energy to build irrigation  systems that can increase production. Similarly, Food for Training projects allow the poor to devote time to learning skills that will sustain  them economically in the future. For more information: www.wfp.org/food-assets. HIV/AIDS WFP uses its food rations  to reduce the blow of HIV and AIDS. The agency distributes its rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, so they can keep providing for their families for longer and have time to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children--the next generation of food providers in developing countries. For more information: www.wfp.org/hiv-aids. Purchase for Progress WFP buys large amounts of food in developing countries. It has this purchasing power and uses it to help poor farmers contact reliable markets where they can get competitive prices for their produce. With secure markets, farmers will be encouraged to produce more and innovate .The knock-on effect is producing more food for everyone. For more information: www.wfp.ofp/purchase-progress.

Let's break down these factors and analyze how discovering oil in countries other than the Middle East might affect them. 1. Supply and demand: The main reason that oil prices fluctuate is due to supply and demand. If more oil is discovered in countries outside of the Middle East, global oil supply would increase. This could lead to a temporary decrease in oil prices. However, considering the current trend towards more eco-friendly and sustainable means of transportation, the demand for petrol might continue to decrease despite temporary changes in oil prices.  2. International relations and geopolitics: Dependence on oil imports from the Middle East has historically led to tense geopolitical relationships between oil-exporting and oil-importing countries. If oil reserves are discovered in other regions, international relations might become more stable, as nations would have more diverse sources of oil imports. This could reduce the risk of conflicts and economic turbulence caused by issues related to the oil market. However, it is also essential to note that tensions around oil production might shift to new regions where the reserves have been discovered. 3. Technological advancements and alternative energy sources: The world today is moving towards adopting greener, more sustainable, and renewable sources of energy. Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more popular, affordable, and accessible due to advances in battery technology and increasing charging infrastructure. Most major automobile manufacturers are investing heavily in the development of electric and hybrid vehicles, accelerating the transition away from petrol-run cars. This shift is likely to continue, even if oil is found in regions other than the Middle East. 4. Environmental concerns and government policies: There is a growing global awareness about the impact of fossil fuel consumption on the environment and climate change. Many governments across the world are implementing policies and incentives to encourage the use of cleaner and more sustainable modes of transportation. These initiatives are expected to continue and strengthen in the coming years, thus leading to reduced reliance on petrol-run cars, regardless of the location of oil reserves. In conclusion, discovering oil in countries other than the Middle East might have short-term effects on oil prices and international relations, but it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the ongoing transition towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly modes of transportation. Therefore, there will likely be fewer petrol-run cars in the long run, regardless of the new oil reserves location."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The guy had the SAME halibut special ... but the fish was twice as thick as mine and it was a normal size. It hardly looked like the same entree!  I couldn't help but ask the waitress why there was such a difference. (I hated sounding so petty.) She said - that the couple were sharing the halibut.

Here is a hypothesis: Journalism addresses matters of public importance, and this should be recognized.  Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the premise, if true, supports the hypothesis, it is essential to analyze them independently and identify any direct or indirect correlations. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis. Premise: The premise suggests that the moral takeaway might be recognizing the need for more humility when considering the usefulness of journalism in addressing matters of public importance. Essentially, it implies that journalists or the public should not overstate journalism's benefits in tackling significant public issues. Hypothesis: The hypothesis posits that journalism does address matters of public importance, and this role should be acknowledged by society or the journalism industry. First, both the premise and hypothesis acknowledge that journalism has a role in addressing matters of public importance. The difference between the two statements lies in their approach to recognizing this role. The premise suggests that there should be greater humility in acknowledging journalism's usefulness, while the hypothesis asserts that journalism's role should be openly recognized. Now, let's analyze if the premise's truth leads to the hypothesis being true. If we accept the premise that there should be more humility about the usefulness of journalism, it still implies its usefulness and admits that journalism plays a role in addressing public issues. The element of humility does not negate the fact that journalism has a role; it merely cautions against overstating or overestimating that role. Therefore, it can be concluded that if the premise is true, then it indirectly supports the hypothesis, as acknowledging the necessity for humility in understanding journalism's usefulness still implies that journalism does have a role in addressing matters of public importance. However, it's important to understand that the premise calls for a more nuanced and humble approach to acknowledging journalism's value, while the hypothesis enables a more direct and open recognition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bevo is the name of the university's live mascot, a Longhorn steer, and represents the spirit of the school during various events and sporting games. The Bevo mascot has been part of the University of Texas tradition since 1916. The term \\"Bevo sign\\" that you found on Google may not directly connect to this mascot in the context of your search.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Suspect in Northridge shootings arrested in Las Vegas, police say Los Angeles Police Department detectives have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting deaths of four people in Northridge outside an unlicensed boarding home, department officials confirmed. Few details were released about the circumstances of the arrest, which took place without incident overnight in Las Vegas, according to several sources familiar with the case. A news conference is planned for later Tuesday. Police would not immediately identify the suspect, citing the ongoing investigation, but said he was involved in the shooting early Sunday in the 17400 block of Devonshire Street. PHOTOS: Four killed in shooting at Northridge home Sources said the shooting may have been prompted by a personal dispute, but did not elaborate. Officers responded to a home about 4:25 a.m. Sunday after a 911 caller reported yelling and shots fired, police said. Authorities found four people — two men and two women — shot dead outside. No weapon was recovered at the home, prompting police to rule out a murder-suicide. Three of the victims — a man and two women — were shot on the walkway on the left side of the home, a source familiar with the case told The Times on Monday. They were all wearing hooded sweat shirts and were about two feet apart from one another. All three had at least one bullet wound to the head. One victim was crumpled on her knees, the source said, her face buried in the palms of her hands, \\"almost like she was praying.\\" The other two victims on the walkway were face down. The fourth victim — a man — was farther away and appeared as if he was trying to run to the backyard when he was shot. He had at least one gunshot wound, according to the source. \\"It looked like a quick kill,\\" said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is ongoing. The names of the victims have not been released. Police said the women were in their mid-20s; one man was in his mid-30s and the other man in his late 40s. Authorities said the home was an illegal boardinghouse, with up to 17 people living in conditions that Los Angeles City Councilman Mitchell Englander described as \\"deplorable.\\" The home had so much debris and so many partitions that one room could be accessed only through a window, he said. A trail of extension cords led investigators to the backyard, where several makeshift living quarters had been assembled. The owner of the home, Yag Kapil, said he rented out rooms but denied he was running a boardinghouse. Kapil, 78, who lives at the home, said he is bedridden and was sleeping at the time of the shootings. He said he didn't hear anything and didn't know the victims. The slayings stunned the quiet Northridge street, which residents said was the kind where neighbors knew each other and walked to the grocery store or synagogue nearby. \\"It's usually sleepy-time America,\\" said Richard Rutherford, 58, who was awakened by the gunfire. The violent crime rate for Northridge falls in the middle of all Los Angeles neighborhoods, but homicide is rare in the community, according to LAPD data analyzed in The Times' Crime L.A. database. In the previous six months, Northridge had one homicide out of the 89 violent crimes reported. Since 2007, and before Sunday's quadruple homicide, Northridge had 11 homicides, 10 of them south of Nordhoff Street. The location of Sunday's slayings is on the border with Granada Hills, which typically has a much lower violent-crime rate than Northridge.

Jay and Bella loved fish tanks. They had everything they needed for a new tank except for some plants. They set the tank up and ordered some plants from a web site. It took 2 weeks for the plants to arrive.","output":"When the plants finally arrived, Jay and Bella eagerly opened the package, excited to add the final touch to their fish tank. The first step was to carefully inspect the plants for any sign of damage or disease, as they wanted to ensure that the aquatic environment they were creating was healthy for their fish. Satisfied with the condition of the plants, Jay and Bella decided to give them a gentle rinse under cool, running water. They did this to remove any dirt or debris that could potentially harm the water quality in their fish tank. Next, Jay and Bella prepared the fish tank for the addition of the plants. They turned off the aquarium light and any pumps or filters connected to the tank to ensure a calm and safe installation process. They also lowered the water level slightly to make it easier to place the plants in the substrate without making a mess. With the fish tank prepped, Jay and Bella began the process of adding the plants. They carefully chose the ideal location for each plant based on its lighting and space requirements for optimal growth. They used a fine-tipped pair of aquascaping tweezers to help them place the plants in the substrate, pushing them in far enough to secure them without damaging the roots. Once all the plants were securely in place, Jay and Bella gently added more water to the tank, filling it back up to the appropriate level. They turned on the aquarium light and pumped in some liquid fertilizer to give the plants an initial boost of nutrients. Since the plants would take some time to acclimate to their new environment, Jay and Bella decided to wait a few days before introducing fish into the tank. This would give the plants a chance to settle and start absorbing nutrients, making the environment more stable and suitable for the fish. During this time, they monitored the water parameters using a test kit to ensure that the plants were effectively cycling the water. Once the water parameters were stable and suitable for fish, Jay and Bella selected a variety of colorful and vibrant fish species to add to their new, lush aquatic environment. As the days turned into weeks, Jay and Bella marveled at the beauty of the thriving aquatic ecosystem they had created. The plants flourished and provided a serene haven for the fish as they swam gracefully around the tank. The fish tank became a symbol of Jay and Bella's dedication to their shared passion and love for the underwater world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which may sound odd coming from someone who ceaselessly praises love and sex, but it is true. I am not a fan. My mother and father were married in a small Baptist Church on Valentine’s Day in 1959. They are no longer together. They are still technically married but my father now lives in a residential care home for dementia patients and my mother lives alone. My father’s disease makes him angry and aggressive leaving my mother with blurred and fading memories of his kindness. It is a sad day for all those whose partners are transformed into strangers by illnesses. Some things aren’t fair. It is my step(ish) daughter’s birthday on Valentine’s Day (I am not married to my boyfriend so I can’t claim to be a step-mum and there is no other term for it). The end of my boyfriend’s marriage has put continents between him and his children. When he hangs up the phone after talking to his daughter, his eyes are dark with pain. It is a sad day for all those whose love is diluted by oceans. Some things can’t be changed. I remember the last Valentine’s Day I spent with my ex-husband. I was a couple of weeks away from moving out but I hadn’t told him yet. I felt sick and scared and heartbroken. My husband and I passed the entire day without speaking. As I stood on the edge of the cliff summoning up the courage to jump, I felt entirely alone. It is a sad day for all those whose love has withered away. Some things can’t be fixed. I want to believe that “love is all you need” because it feels as though it could almost be true, but then I remember, on days like this, that for as many hearts that sing, there are equally as many that struggle to beat.

Craig, on the other hand, was a bookworm from a young age, forever devouring one library book after another. It was only natural that the two friends would turn to each other for help in navigating their shared interest in literature. The long book Craig had picked up was a highly anticipated new release, generating a buzz around town and igniting the curiosity of both voracious readers and casual book lovers alike. The story revolved around a fantastical world filled with marvelous creatures, mythical beings, and thrilling adventures. The due date for the book was fast approaching, but Jason had yet to crack open its cover. Knowing that his friend would miss the opportunity to immerse himself in the wonderful world the book had to offer if left to his own devices, Craig decided to step in and help. The two friends spent days together, nestled in the cozy nook of Craig's living room, as Craig patiently and engagingly read the adventure to Jason. They laughed together at the humorous parts, gasped in shock at unexpected twists, and occasionally paused to mull over a particularly profound phrase or idea. The outside world seemed to vanish entirely as they lost themselves in the magical, captivating realm brought to life by the book. Jason, ears attentively catching every word, felt profoundly grateful for his friend's help. Reading the long book was a challenge he had been reluctant to face alone, but with Craig to steer him through the labyrinth of prose, he could deeply appreciate the narrative. The journey that the dynamic duo embarked upon seemed no less powerful, real, and transformational than that experienced by the characters themselves. As Craig neared the end of the final chapter, anticipation hung heavy in the air. Each word carefully articulated, every sentence filled with emotion, it felt as though all the loose ends of the story were gradually being woven together. When Craig at last finished reading, a heavy silence permeated the room, the weight of the story's conclusion resting upon both friends. Their minds were filled to the brim with vivid imagery, heart-stopping action sequences, profound wisdom, and emotional connection to the characters. During the subsequent days, Craig and Jason found themselves reflecting on their shared experience. The long book stirred something within them, igniting a fire of passion for literature that they had previously only sensed on an individual level. Jason's newfound appreciation for understanding complex narratives, characters, and subtexts drove him to confront his reading difficulties and become increasingly committed to improving his fluency. Eventually, Jason emerged from this experience a more confident and eager reader than ever before, largely due to Craig's unwavering support and dedication. Craig found satisfaction in having helped his friend and solidifying their bond over their shared love of literature. The feat of conquering the long book before the due date became one of many adventures both friends would face together, their passion uniting them as they dared to step into brave new worlds through the pages of countless books."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Colbert (Walter Kingsford), the king's trusted adviser, persuades the king to secretly send the second child, Philippe, away to Gascony to be raised by his majesty's dear friend, d'Artagnan (Warren William), in order to avert a possible civil war later. Fouquet (Joseph Schildkraut), a mere cardinal's messenger at the time, finds out about the twin and uses this to advance his career. Twenty years later, he is the Minister of Finance under Louis XIV. The king is hated by the commoners for levying oppressive taxes and for executioning them for not paying them. Fouquet sends soldiers to force d'Artagnan and his people to pay the taxes, though the old king had exempted him and his village from them. They are driven off, but return in much greater numbers and, with great difficulty, capture d'Artagnan, the three musketeers and Philippe. Louis is about to order their executions when Colbert tells him about Philippe's uncanny resemblance to him. As Louis is aware of an assassination attempt to take place that day (but not where or when), he makes Philippe impersonate him in exchange for his friends' lives.

The other is the Southern Camerons: Dr. Cameron, his wife, their two daughters, and three sons. The Stoneman brothers visit the Cameron estate in South Carolina, representing the Old South. Phil, the elder Stoneman son, falls in love with Margaret Cameron, while young Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman. When the Civil War begins, these young men enlist in their respective armies. Black militiamen under a white leader ransack the Cameron house; the Cameron women are rescued by Confederate soldiers who rout the militia. Meanwhile, the younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in the war. Ben Cameron leads a heroic charge at the Siege of Petersburg, earning the nickname of \\"the Little Colonel\\".

How to recognize hives (rash )<br>Detect itchy or stinging skin spots. Hives may begin as an itchy or stinging area on your skin. If you begin to notice itching, stinging or pain on any parts of your skin with or without a specific cause, it may be hives and you could develop welts. Can we draw the following conclusion? Hives can kill.","output":"Hives, also known as urticaria, are a common skin condition characterized by the appearance of raised, red, itchy welts on the skin. They are often caused by an allergic reaction to something, but can also develop in response to infection, stress, or physical stimuli such as heat or cold. While hives can be unpleasant and uncomfortable, they are generally not life-threatening. However, in some cases, they may be indicative of a more serious underlying medical condition that requires attention. So, while it is incorrect to draw the conclusion that \\"hives can kill,\\" it is important to be aware of the potential complications and seek appropriate medical care when necessary. To recognize hives, follow these steps: 1. Inspect your skin for raised welts or bumps: Hives often present as raised, red, or pale-colored welts that appear suddenly on the skin. These welts may vary in size, shape, and location, and can occur individually or merge to form larger areas. 2. Check for itching or stinging: Hives are typically accompanied by itching, stinging, or a burning sensation. If you are experiencing these sensations, particularly in conjunction with the appearance of welts, you may have hives. 3. Monitor for changes: Hives can appear and disappear quickly, often within a few hours. If you notice the welts on your skin are changing in size, shape, or location, you may be dealing with hives. 4. Observe the duration of symptoms: Hives usually last for a short period, often less than 24 hours. However, there are instances where hives can last longer, even up to six weeks (known as chronic urticaria). If your symptoms persist, it is important to consult your healthcare provider for proper evaluation and management. 5. Pay attention to potential triggers: Identifying possible triggers, such as specific foods, medications, or environmental factors, may aid in determining whether the symptoms are hives. Document any new exposures, dietary changes, or other situations that could possibly be linked to your hives to help with diagnosis and treatment. Though hives themselves are typically not life-threatening, it is crucial to consider the possibility of a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a systemic reaction that can be potentially fatal and requires immediate medical attention. Signs and symptoms may include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, rapid or weak pulse, nausea, vomiting, and a sudden drop in blood pressure. If you suspect you or someone you know is experiencing anaphylactic symptoms along with hives, seek emergency medical care right away. In conclusion, while hives are generally not life-threatening, they can sometimes indicate a more severe underlying issue, such as anaphylaxis or an underlying medical condition. It is essential to monitor your symptoms, recognize potential triggers, and consult your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment when necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While it's true that the premise involves a group of people practicing in a field, there's no explicit reference to the game of soccer or any activities typically associated with it. Instead, it's mentioned that a man is performing a \\"high kick in the air\\", which might hint at some form of martial art practice, but it could also be interpreted in numerous other ways.  Moreover, the woman in the black tank top watching the man adds another layer of ambiguity. She could be a trainer, an observer, a participant taking a rest, or just someone casually watching. Again, there’s no clear link to soccer. In order to confirm the hypothesis that they are playing a soccer game, there would need to be additional contextual clues referencing elements of the game itself. For instance, we might look for descriptions of typical soccer equipment like a ball, soccer goals, or cleats. We might also look for specific actions that are unique to soccer, such as dribbling the ball, scoring goals, or defending.  Therefore, as it currently stands, the hypothesis does not follow necessarily from the premise. The premise leaves a number of possibilities open and the hypothesis is just one potential explanation among many.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What did Slavicisation do?\\"  Context: \\"The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"\\"Slavicisation\\" refers to the cultural, linguistic, and social process of adopting or borrowing Slavic culture, language, and norms, typically by non-Slavic societies. In the context you have provided, Slavicisation was a key contributor to the absorption and assimilation of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans in Eastern Europe (modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans) by the Proto-Slavic population of the region approximately by the 6th century AD. This process ultimately led to the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages in the region.  This process of Slavicisation was typically not a rapid process, but extended over several centuries during which the original language and culture of the absorbed societies progressively disappeared or evolved, and the cultures, languages, and identities of the incoming Slavic peoples increasingly became dominant.  Therefore, Slavicisation contributed to the major linguistic and cultural shifts observed in Eastern Europe and was instrumental in shaping the region's modern day linguistic and cultural landscape."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Tom handed me his peanut butter sandwich to share with his new brother.\\" This suggests that Tom was trying to give a sandwich to the baby, but it isn't directly stated that the baby couldn't eat it yet. However, later in the passage, we see that the narrator has to explain to Tom that small babies drink their milk from a bottle of warm milk.

Premise: \\"Horrible-looking things, aren't they?\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Horrible looking beasts, aren't they?\\"?","output":"To analyze the entailment of the hypothesis \\"Horrible looking beasts, aren't they?\\" based on the premise \\"Horrible-looking things, aren't they?\\" it is essential to begin by defining the terminology and understanding the logical structure of the statements. Entailment is a logical relation between two statements where the truth of one statement necessitates the truth of the other. In other words, if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true. In the premise, \\"Horrible-looking things, aren't they?\\" the key terms can be broken down as follows: - \\"Horrible-looking\\": A term used to describe something that has an unpleasant or repulsive appearance. - \\"Things\\": A general term that can refer to any object, entity, or being. In this context, it implies that the speaker is referring to various items or beings that share the described attribute (horrible-looking). In the hypothesis, \\"Horrible looking beasts, aren't they?\\" the terminology can be broken down similarly. Here are the definitions of the key terms in the hypothesis: - \\"Horrible-looking\\": As before, this term is used to describe something with an unpleasant or repulsive appearance. - \\"Beasts\\": A term for non-human animals, typically large and wild ones, often with a negative connotation and implying that they are frightening, dangerous, or unpleasant in appearance. Now let's analyze the entailment. The premise states that the things under discussion are horrible-looking, and the hypothesis is inquiring if these horrible-looking entities are indeed beasts. Thus, the hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the premise, as the truth of one statement does not necessarily guarantee the truth of the other statement. This is because the word \\"things\\" in the premise is more general and can encompass a broader range of objects or entities. While the word \\"beasts\\" used in the hypothesis is a subset of \\"things,\\" they represent a specific category of creatures (non-human animals, especially the massive and wild ones). There could be other entities (such as human-built structures, objects, plants, or phenomenon) that fit the description of horrible-looking but are not beasts.  For example, if someone said, \\"Horrible-looking things, aren't they?\\" while pointing at a collection of misshapen statues, this premise could be true. However, it does not entail that they must be \\"horrible looking beasts,\\" as they could instead be inanimate objects or entirely human creations. In conclusion, although the premise \\"Horrible-looking things, aren't they?\\" may share common attributes with the hypothesis \\"Horrible looking beasts, aren't they?\\" (specifically, describing something as having an unpleasant or repulsive appearance), the entailment does not hold in this case. The truth of the premise does not necessarily guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, since the premise refers to a more general category of \\"things,\\" while the hypothesis specifically inquires about \\"beasts.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Justification: To isolate the term with the variable (in this case, -16*c) on one side of the equation, we need to eliminate the constant term (in this case, 197). We do this by performing the inverse operation, which is subtraction in this case. -16*c + 197 - 197 = 293 - 197 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.

Jerika Bolen, an Appleton, Wisconsin, resident who has spinal muscular atrophy type 2, plans to turn off her nighttime breathing assistance at the end of August with the full support of her mother Jen.      “There were a lot of tears, but then I realized I’m going to be in a better place, and I’m not going to be in this terrible pain. I’ve been working on it and thinking about it for way longer than anyone else has,” Bolen told Appleton’s Post-Crescent News.      Many adults with SMA are saddened by her decision and disturbed her mother and the media aren’t questioning it.      “She’s not sick, she’s not terminal, she’s just in pain. Get her some help, but don’t let her die,” says Emily Wolinsky, president of NMD United, an organization by and for people living with neuromuscular diseases such as SMA. She is also the creator of Dear Julianna, a campaign in which adults with neuromuscular diseases wrote life-affirming letters to a 5-year-old child with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a type of NMD, whose mother allowed her to die when she said she “wanted to go to heaven” instead of the hospital.      Much of the media coverage makes a point of saying most don’t survive SMA past adolescence, but there are many examples of adults with SMA who have pain, but lead rewarding lives.      “I use a ventilator most of the day, a wheelchair, and a lot of services and my life (even with pain) is pretty fantastic,” says Alice Wong, 42, founder of the Disability Visibility Project, who has the same diagnosis as Jerika.      Most with SMA have had surgeries, especially in their teens, but many wonder why the media hasn’t investigated Bolen’s 38 surgeries claim.      “Thirty-eight surgeries in 14 years is a lot,” says Wolinsky. Polling her friends, she found the most they’d had was two before age 18. “Maybe it’s the surgeries, not the diagnosis that’s exacerbating her pain.”      Still, there’s a lot of variability in lived experience, shouldn’t Bolen have the right to decide her fate when she wants to?      “Some in the disability community confuse value of life with quality of life and no one, disability or not, can make a judgment on quality of life except the person living the life. The main right she needs is the right to be herself, provided that self is fully-informed and gutsy,” says Ruth von Fuchs, president of Right to Die Canada. In Canada, assisted suicide is legal for those over 18 when death is “reasonably foreseeable.” But Bolen is only 14, and without action on her part, her death is not “reasonably foreseeable.”      Bolen’s lack of information may be the problem, just no one in the media seems to mind.      “If this was a nondisabled girl the same age who wants to end her life for similar reasons, would we be so quick to support it? Would the media be as eager to cover a person’s quest to raise money for an accessible van or home compared to a community-wide effort to put together her ‘Last Dance?” asks Wong. ||||| Published on Jul 20, 2016      Jerika Bolen, 14, who was diagnosed with Type 2 Spinal Muscular Atrophy, has decided to go on hospice and live out her final wishes over the summer including having a prom July, 22, 2016, at the Grand Meridian in Appleton, Wis.

She says she wants to \\"be free\\" and scheduled her own death. Now, disabled parent's activists are trying to intervene.      Jerika Bolen and her mother Jen are illuminated by green fireworks Saturday, July 2, 2016 in Menominee, Mich. Danny Damiani/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin (Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)      APPLETON, Wis. — Disability rights groups are attempting to intervene in an Appleton teenager’s decision to cease medical treatment and die of the incurable disease that has racked her body and left her in constant pain.      Carrie Ann Lucas, executive director of the Colorado-based Disabled Parents Rights, said her organization is one of several that have asked for child-protection authorities to investigate the case of 14-year-old Jerika Bolen, whose decision to enter hospice care at the end of summer gained national attention.      “A child doesn’t have the capacity to make those types of decisions, and under the eyes of the law, this is a child,” Lucas said Tuesday.      Jerika suffers from Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2. She and her mother, Jen Bolen, said earlier this summer that Jerika would go without her ventilator while under hospice care in early September, essentially scheduling her own death. Her story drew an outpouring of support when her family, friends and her care team held a prom, dubbed Jerika's Last Dance, in late July.      On Tuesday, Jen Bolen asked for privacy and declined further comment about her daughter's medical care.      Melissa Blom, director of Outagamie County’s Children, Youth and Families Division, also declined comment on whether her office has received a referral or opened an investigation, citing the confidentiality of child-welfare cases.      Jerika was diagnosed as a baby with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, often referred to as SMA. The incurable disease destroys nerve cells in the brain stem and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle activity. Jerika has never walked, and today her movement is mostly limited to her head and hands.      Jerika said she’s in constant pain — about a seven on a scale of one to 10 on her best days. She expressed concern that her pain and the need for more invasive medical interventions would grow as her body continues to deteriorate.      Lucas, who said she is unaware of whether a child-protection investigation has commenced, said her organization is not asking that Jerika be removed from her mother’s care.      “Foster care will not solve this problem,” she said.      But Jerika is in need of mental health care, not additional support for ending her life, Lucas said.      Lucas said four organizations sent a joint letter to the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families asking for intervention, and she followed up with a phone call to Outagamie County's Children, Youth and Families Division. The other organizations are Not Dead Yet, NMD United and the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, Lucas said.      Debate began to bubble as many reached out to celebrate Jerika's life in July. More than a 1,000 people arrived at a prom thrown in Jerika's honor as a last wish. Police and firefighters provided a motorcade. She received cards and gifts from around the world and shout-outs from a number of celebrities.      But her decision also drew pleas that she change her mind, including from adults with Spinal Muscular Atrophy.      Jen Bolen, in a July interview, said those critical of Jerika's decision fail to understand the depth of medical intervention it’s taken for her to reach her teenage years.      \\"I was fighting for my kid,\\" she said. \\"I never thought I'd be on this side of things.\\"      Lucas, meanwhile, said Jerika's decision — and the support she's received — is an important issue to the disability rights community. Those with disabilities have equal rights to child protection, which includes efforts to ensure parents are acting in their children’s best interests, she said.      Though Jerika's disease is progressive, it isn’t “acutely terminal,” Lucas said, and she questions whether simply withholding treatment would be sufficient to end her life quickly.      When it’s a decision of death, “it’s never in the child’s best interests,” Lucas argued.      Jerika’s story is far from the first time end-of-life decisions have drawn controversy.      Perhaps the most famous case was that of Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged Florida woman who was taken off of life support in 2005 after a family battle and a national debate over decision-making authority.      Diane Coleman, executive director of the anti-euthanasia organization Not Dead Yet, compared the Bolens’ situation to that of Julianna Snow, a 5-year-old Oregon girl who was given the choice by her parents on whether to continue medical treatment.      Snow, who had an incurable neurodegenerative illness, chose against further hospitalization and died in June after spending 18 months in hospice care.      Coleman questioned both cases based on their ages. But her organization views euthanasia as a form of discrimination against the old, ill and disabled.      “I worry that there’s an attitude in the health care profession that really writes people off with disabilities,” she said. “I worry that people like Jerika and Julianna are in the throes of that, and without adequate support.”      The withholding of treatment from the disabled was recently subject of court scrutiny in Wisconsin based on a lawsuit brought by the Disability Rights Wisconsin organization.      In 2009, the organization sued five doctors from UW Health over their withholding of treatment from two developmentally disabled patients, including a 13-year-old boy they had placed in hospice care. Lawyers argued the boy would have recovered from pneumonia.      The case was dismissed at the circuit court level, and in 2014, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals upheld that decision, putting an end to the lawsuit.      Jerika Bolen laughs with friend Mackenzie Falck as they watch fireworks together with Haley Paradiso and Hanna Gove during an Independence Day celebration at Jerika's grandparents home Saturday July 2, 2016 in Menominee, Mich. (Photo: Danny Damiani/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)      Attorneys for Disability Rights Wisconsin argued “parents had no right to direct the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment to their children who are not in (a persistent vegetative state.)”      The court rejected the organization's arguments that withholding of care violated the patients' due process rights.

Which language is this?","output":"This sentence is in German. \\"Die Aussprache ist geschlossen\\" translates to \\"The discussion is closed\\" in English. German, or Deutsch, is a West Germanic language that is widely spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and other regions in Europe. German is known for its complex grammar rules, including gendered nouns, various cases, and long compound words. The language uses three genders for nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter, each with their respective articles \\"der,\\" \\"die,\\" and \\"das.\\" In addition, nouns in German have four grammatical cases: nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive. These cases are used to show the function of a noun or pronoun in a sentence. German pronunciation is relatively straightforward compared to some other languages, as the pronunciation of words tends to follow consistent rules. The standard German consonants and vowels are similar to those in English; however, there are a few unique sounds, such as the guttural \\"ch\\" and the umlauted vowels \\"ä,\\" \\"ö,\\" and \\"ü.\\" The German language has a rich history that dates back to the Early Middle Ages. The Old High German period (6th to 11th centuries) saw the first significant written German texts, such as the Hildebrandslied, an epic poem written in the 8th century. During the Middle High German period (11th to 13th centuries), courtly literature flourished, including the works of the Minnesänger, who composed love songs and poems. One of the most significant historical events that influenced the German language was Martin Luther's translation of the Bible into German in the 16th century. This translation played a vital role in standardizing German grammar and vocabulary, which eventually led to the development of modern German. Today, German is spoken by more than 100 million people worldwide and is an official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein. It is also an official language of the European Union. German is an essential second language for many Europeans, and learning the language can open doors to cultural experiences and business opportunities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: At stake is the future of this country, torn between Russia and Europe, and riven by anger over the corruption and cronyism in Yanukovych’s government. For two months, a partnership of pro-Europe liberals, die-hard nationalists, and critics of the ruling family and its circle of oligarchs has carried out a protracted campaign of protest, almost all of it peaceful. That moment could be nearing an end. The deaths of three and possibly more activists shocked and energized the legions of protesters, who again turned out Wednesday evening. One of the victims was shot four times, medics said. Police denied they had used firearms, though they could be seen aiming rifles during the day. The dead are being portrayed as martyrs. The politicians broke off the talks after three hours, and the opposition leaders later delivered angry avowals of their determination to oust Yanukovych but said they planned to continue the dialogue Thursday. “If the president does not go forward” on a peaceful resolution, said Vitali Klitschko, head of the opposition UDAR party, “tomorrow we’ll go on the offensive.” As darkness fell, tens of thousands of protesters flocked through snow to be on hand to defend Independence Square, known to all simply as the Maidan, after fears spread that the police would try Wednesday night to clear the encampment, which has been in place since Nov. 21. They had twice swept away the young protesters on nearby Hrushevsky Street, by the stadium, but the opposition forces reclaimed the street each time. The aggressive police action occurred on Unification Day, a national holiday. It drove the already deep divide between Yanukovych and his opponents to the point where a negotiated settlement looks difficult. The two sides have just 24 hours to prevent bloodshed, Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the opposition Fatherland party said Wednesday night after he left the president’s office. “After that, if I get a bullet in my head, then so be it,” he said. “We’re going to kick the authorities out. We’re going to win and have the new Ukraine that we deserve,” said Oleh Tiahnybok, head of the nationalist Svoboda party, who also took part. The mood on the Maidan on Wednesday evening, as it filled with protesters, was serious but not grim. As young men in helmets and improvised body armor came and went from Hrushevsky Street, old women on the Maidan watched and made the sign of the cross. Youths furiously chipped away at the newly fallen but already packed snow, while others scooped it up into sandbags, to be used to bolster the formidable barricades built on foundations of ice and snow last month. Rain and warm weather have since caused considerable depletion, but the cold has returned, and that’s welcome news for the opposition. On Hrushevsky, protesters set alight piles of tires, sending thick black smoke westward across Kiev. Their goal was to create a smokescreen behind which they industriously constructed a fallback barricade in an attempt to prevent another police sweep. Many of those injured Wednesday were broadcast journalists and medics, leading to accusations that they had been deliberately targeted. All told, hundreds of injuries have been reported, on both sides. The activist beaten to death was Yuriy Verbytskiy, a resident of the western city of Lviv who was on Hrushevsky Street. He was kidnapped from a Kiev hospital Tuesday night after he had sought treatment for a splinter in his eye. Another man, Ihor Lutsenko, who was abducted with him, was beaten but later released. Verbytskiy’s body was found near the airport, according to his brother. The protest began when Yanukovych suddenly backed off a trade deal with Europe and turned to Russia for support. It quickly broadened to include demands that he step down. Throughout, protest leaders continually stressed the need to use peaceful means to pursue their ends. But Yanukovych hung on, and last week his party rammed through harsh new laws restricting protest and speech. On Sunday evening, a breakaway group of frustrated young nationalists, led by a group called Pravy Sektor, marched off the Maidan to Hrushevsky Street, where they were confronted by police and began throwing stones, fireworks and molotov cocktails at them. Police responded with stun grenades and rubber bullets. The confrontation on Hrushevsky Street persisted, and it complicated the task for opposition leaders who have denounced violence as self-defeating. But the sight of young men taking the fight to the police thrilled thousands of spectators who didn’t play a direct role in the clashes. The violence, and especially Wednesday’s escalation, seemed only to harden the resolve of both sides, even as the talks were getting underway. Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said the opposition has to decide once and for all whether it will renounce the violence of the nationalists on Hrushevsky or embrace it and suffer take the consequences. He then flew off to an economic forum in Davos, Switzerland — though news agencies here reported that his invitation had been withdrawn. The U.S. Embassy in Kiev announced that it has revoked the visas of Ukrainians it deems responsible for the violence here. It said it would not identify those people, but official U.S. statements on the crisis suggest that those affected are probably Ukrainian government or police officials. In Washington, Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the State Department, released a statement saying that the United States “strongly condemns” the violence in Kiev. “Increased tensions in Ukraine are a direct consequence of the Ukrainian government’s failure to engage in real dialogue and the passage of anti-democratic legislation on January 16,” it said. “However, the aggressive actions of members of extreme-right group Pravy Sektor are not acceptable and are inflaming conditions on the streets and undermining the efforts of peaceful protesters. We likewise deplore violence by unofficial groups known as ‘titushki.’ “We also condemn the targeted attacks against journalists and peaceful protesters, including detentions.” The issue of thugs for hire, working on behalf of Yanukovych and known here as “titushki,” has become a potent addition to the grievances of the protesters. Opposition groups have been scouting the streets of Kiev the past two nights in search of titushki, who are accused of smashing cars and beating up passersby. At least a dozen young men have been rounded up and taken to the protest headquarters. Almost all of them are teenagers. The Interior Ministry declared that 40 people were “kidnapped” in Kiev on Tuesday night, clearly referring to what the opposition believes is an act of self-defense.

The movie examines the life of five womenAdela, Leire, Maricarmen, Anita & Isabelwho have completely different lives and choices of shoes. Their shoes is the first superficial, yet affixed with some glancing meaning, clue we get at their fragile identities. In a theatrically embroidered and embellished way, a podiatrist tries to esoterically reveal the deepest secrets of a woman's souls by the sole of her feet. The premise is risky and slightly contrived, but the tone and depth of the movie takes a daring plunge for the good. What may have been light-hearted and superficial, quickly switches gear with the a superb dysfunctional couple scene that leaves the viewer riveted for minutes, seeing the love or lack thereof, the pain, the confusion, the hope, the needs and escape mechanisms develop through minutes different rooms of the house and down to the street and eventually below... What a scene (!) , but there will be others as effective to follow and strengthen the strong characterization and directing displayed in this slice of life affair. Moving along, a woman has lost the husband she loved and inherited his kids and his taxi, while another has completely lost her husband emotionally, sexually, intellectually, but not physically. A ghost, a pending divorce reproach, regret & remorse. A new love? Can you love a mirage? Can you love the person in the mirror? Can you love someone you can't love? Or think you can't love? Can you love and live life even though it will always be somewhat hopeless? Yet isn't it exactly these hopes and dreams that keep us here grounded and in a spectrum of relative happiness?

Mac OS X: Mac OS X, also known as macOS, is based on the Unix-like operating system called Darwin, which is written primarily in C and C++. However, its user interface layer, called Aqua, is written in Objective-C. Additionally, macOS supports application development using programming languages such as Swift, Objective-C, AppleScript, and more. Linux: The Linux operating system is mostly written in C, which provides a high level of compatibility across various hardware platforms while still being an efficient and low-level language. Some parts are also written in Assembly, Python, and other scripting languages. The userland tools and applications for Linux are developed using a variety of languages, such as C, C++, Python, Perl, and others. Question 2: Is it easy to port apps written for Linux to run on Mac OS X? This question refers to the ease of converting or adapting applications developed for Linux to be compatible with Mac OS X. The process of porting applications between these platforms depends significantly on the nature of the specific application and the programming languages, libraries, and frameworks used in its development. Because Mac OS X is based on a Unix-like system, many command-line tools and applications can be ported between Linux and Mac OS X relatively easily. On the other hand, graphical applications may require more effort to adapt, particularly if they rely on platform-specific frameworks, libraries, or APIs. In some cases, porting a Linux application to Mac OS X can be facilitated using cross-platform development tools, libraries, or frameworks (e.g., Qt, GTK, or wxWidgets) that support both platforms. In other cases, the application may need to be rewritten or substantially modified to function correctly on Mac OS X, especially if it relies on Linux-specific functionality or interfaces. Ultimately, the ease or difficulty of porting an application from Linux to Mac OS X will depend on the specific circumstances and requirements of the application in question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

The last riddle he ever gives Oskar is proof that New York City once possessed a Sixth Borough. In a flashback, Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy for the socially awkward Oskar who is told \\"If things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Donald Christopher Barber (born 17 April 1930) is an English jazz musician, best known as a bandleader and trombonist. As well as scoring a UK top twenty trad jazz hit, he helped the careers of many musicians, notably the blues singer Ottilie Patterson, who was at one time his wife, and vocalist/banjoist Lonnie Donegan, whose appearances with Barber triggered the skiffle craze of the mid-1950s and who had his first transatlantic hit, \\"Rock Island Line\\", while with Chris Barber's band. His providing an audience for Donegan and, later, Alexis Korner makes Barber a significant figure in the British rhythm and blues and \\"beat boom\\" of the 1960s. The 2017 line up is; Chris Barber and Bob Hunt (trombones); Mike Henry and Pete Rudeforth (trumpets), Bert Brandsma, Nick White and Ian Killoran (clarinets and alto sax, tenor sax, baritone sax). John Watson (drums), John Day (double bass), Joe Farler (banjo & guitar) Pat Halcox, trumpeter with the Chris Barber Band since 31 May 1954, retired after playing his last gig with the Big Chris Barber Band on 16 July 2008. Halcox and Barber were together in the band for 54 years - the longest continuous partnership in the history of jazz, exceeding even that of Duke Ellington and Harry Carney (48 years between 1926 and 1974). Tony Carter (reeds) also left the band at this time. Vic Pitt (double bass) retired in January 2007 after 30 years with the band.  His feature duet with the drummers of the day - \\"Big Noise From Winnetka\\" was not only a feature of the Barber concerts, but also his time with the Kenny Ball band immediately before. When Amy Roberts joined the band in 2011, she was still a student at Royal Northern College of Music and thus not always able to be present. On several tours Bert Brandsma (reeds) replaced her. Brandsma joined as a permanent member in 2012.  At St Luke's, London, on 9 June 2007 Barber appeared in the horn section of Nick Lowe's band during a concert. In 2008 Barber, along with Eric Clapton and others, were involved in a new co-operative record company, Blues Legacy. On 23 July 2009, Barber, Bilk and Ball played a one-off concert at Indigo2 at the O2 in Greenwich. The concert was presented by the British Music Experience.

Now, we need to isolate n. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by 12:     120 / 12 = (12 * n) / 12     This simplifies to:     10 = n So, the solution to the equation -6349 = 12 * n - 6469 is n = 10."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
