You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here's a question: One way to relieve your hunger if you live near the coast is to do what?  Here are possible answers to this question: - grill - go to market - bring home fish - eat hamburger - make bread  I believe the correct choice is \\"bring home fish\\", here's why: A:","output":"Living near the coast offers a unique and abundant source of fresh seafood that can be a sustainable and healthy way to relieve your hunger. Choosing \\"bring home fish\\" as the correct answer presents several advantages over the other options presented. First and foremost, fresh fish is readily available near coastal areas. You can access this rich source of food by either catching fish yourself or purchasing them from local fishermen or fish markets. This way, you can avoid transportation costs and the environmental impact associated with transporting fish from far-off locations. Moreover, fish is a highly nutritious food source. It is rich in high-quality protein, healthy omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals essential for maintaining good health. Consuming fish has been linked to numerous health benefits, including improved heart health, brain function, and even a reduced risk of certain diseases like stroke and certain types of cancer. In addition to being nutritious, fish is also a versatile and delicious food option. It can be prepared in various ways, such as grilling, baking, or steaming, offering diverse flavors and textures to suit individual preferences and dietary needs. Additionally, since many coastal communities have a long-standing tradition of fishing, you can take advantage of their culinary expertise and enjoy delicious seafood dishes that are part of the local gastronomy. In contrast, while the other options like grilling, going to market, eating a hamburger, or making bread can also address your hunger, they may not be as sustainable or healthy as consuming fresh fish. For instance, the meat in hamburgers often comes from livestock farming, which contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. On the other hand, baking bread requires energy and resources for wheat cultivation, milling, and transport, making it less environmentally friendly. Furthermore, consuming processed foods like hamburgers or store-bought bread may not provide the same level of nutrients as fresh fish. These foods might have higher levels of unhealthy fats, sugars, and preservatives, which can contribute to various health problems like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. In conclusion, the choice of \\"bring home fish\\" is the correct and most sustainable answer to relieve your hunger when living near the coast. Not only does it provide a nutritious and versatile food source, but it also supports local fishermen, promotes the consumption of fresh and minimally processed food, and reduces the environmental impact associated with other food production methods. By choosing fresh fish, you can enjoy a delicious meal that benefits both your health and the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one?","output":"To evaluate the similarity between the two sentences, let's first break down their structure and meaning. The first sentence \\"A man is traveling in a boat\\" consists of the following elements: 1. The subject is a man. 2. The action being performed is traveling. 3. The object or means of performing the action is a boat. The second sentence \\"A woman is cutting up a carrot with a knife\\" consists of the following elements: 1. The subject is a woman. 2. The action being performed is cutting up a carrot. 3. The object or means of performing the action is a knife. Now, let's compare the elements of both sentences to determine the level of meaning overlap on a scale from 0 to 5. 1. Subjects: The first sentence has a man as the subject, while the second sentence has a woman. Although both are human beings, they represent different genders. This similarity is small, so we can rate this aspect as 1. 2. Actions: In the first sentence, the action is traveling, while in the second sentence, the action is cutting up a carrot. Traveling is related to movement and transportation, while cutting up a carrot is related to food preparation. These actions belong to completely different domains, so we can rate this aspect as 0. 3. Objects/means: In the first sentence, the means of performing the action is a boat, used for traveling on water. In the second, it is a knife, commonly used for cutting food items. Both objects are tools used for distinct purposes and belong to different domains, so we can rate this aspect as 0. To determine the overall similarity score, we will average the individual similarity scores: (1 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 0.33 Rounded to the nearest whole number, the overall similarity between the two sentences is 0 on a scale from 0 to 5.

In which year was Nelson Mandela released from prison????","output":"Nelson Mandela, the renowned anti-apartheid leader and prominent figure in South Africa's struggle for racial equality, was released from prison on February 11, 1990. Mandela spent 27 years behind bars, serving time in multiple prison facilities, most notably Robben Island and Pollsmoor Prison. His imprisonment began in 1962 when he was arrested and convicted for incitement to strike and illegally leaving the country. He was serving a five-year sentence when he, along with several fellow members of the African National Congress (ANC), was convicted in the famous Rivonia Trial. In the trial, Mandela and other anti-apartheid campaigners faced charges of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government. Consequently, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on June 12, 1964. During his time in prison, Mandela became a symbol of resistance against apartheid and an international rallying point for those opposed to South Africa's racially discriminatory policies. Over the years, his stature increased, and the global demand for his release intensified. In the late 1980s, South Africa came under immense international pressure to avert a looming civil war within its borders. It was under the presidency of F.W. de Klerk that the South African government finally heeded the global call for Mandela's release. After 27 years of incarceration, Nelson Mandela was unconditionally released from Victor Verster Prison near Paarl. His release marked a turning point in South African history and was a massive step towards negotiating an end to apartheid. After his release, Mandela played a pivotal role in dismantling apartheid, leading negotiations between the ANC and the then-ruling National Party. These negotiations eventually culminated in South Africa's first multiracial, democratic elections in 1994. Running as the ANC's candidate, Mandela won the election and went on to become the first black president of South Africa, further cementing his place as an icon for racial equality and reconciliation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis.

News article: The Senate voted along party lines Saturday night to overcome a Republican filibuster and bring to the floor a bill that would overhaul the nation's health-care system.      After days of indecision, the last two Democratic holdouts -- Sens. Blanche Lincoln (Ark.) and Mary Landrieu (La.) -- joined their caucus in supporting a motion to begin debate. The 60 to 39 vote marks a milestone in the decades-old quest for health-care reform, President Obama's top legislative priority.      \\"The road to this point has been started many times,\\" Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said before the vote. \\"It has never been completed.\\"      The debate is expected to last weeks. Reid is aiming for final passage by Christmas.      The House passed a 1 trillion health bill two weeks ago; the 848 billion Senate version represents the work of two committees and hundreds of hours of hearings and deliberations, against a backdrop of fervent Republican opposition. But even as Democrats heralded their victory, they conceded that it represented the end of the beginning -- and not the other way around.      Like Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), a holdout until Friday, Lincoln and Landrieu said they will press Reid for further changes to the bill before committing to its final passage. Above all, the Democratic caucus remains bitterly divided over a government-run insurance option.      Reid quelled an uprising by liberal senators weeks ago by adding a public option to the legislation. But although he included an opt-out clause for states, some moderates -- including Landrieu and Lincoln -- have told Reid they will oppose the Senate bill on final passage unless the provision is dropped.      \\"My vote should in no way be construed by the supporters of this current framework as an indication of how I might vote on the final bill,\\" said Landrieu, adding that she also will seek more generous tax credits for small-business health care.      For Democratic leaders, the weeks ahead are likely to bring additional concessions. Lawmakers are already requesting changes to the legislation, raising concerns related to Medicare, abortion and employer requirements.      To secure support for Saturday's vote, Reid had to agree to a 72-hour review period that Lincoln sought after the bill was introduced Wednesday night. He added a Medicaid clause worth up to 300 million for Landrieu's home state. Although many Democrats pressed Reid to include language to end a federal antitrust exemption for health insurers, he omitted the repeal to lock down Nelson's vote.      Republicans portrayed the vote as tantamount to an endorsement of the underlying bill, or \\"a vote for higher premiums, cuts to Medicare, and more taxes,\\" as Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) declared.      \\"All those people who are concerned about the high cost of health care today aren't getting relief under the Democrat plan,\\" said Sen. John Thune (S.D.). \\"In fact, their lives are going to get much, much worse.\\"      But Democratic leaders said the vote provided a jolt of momentum that vastly improved prospects for a completed Senate bill before the Christmas break, leaving January for negotiations with the House. The goal now is to deliver final legislation to Obama in time for the State of the Union address in late January.      Reid requested that senators vote from their chairs, a formality generally reserved for such historic matters as the confirmations of Supreme Court nominees. Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-Ohio) was not present and did not vote.      Afterward, supporters of health-care reform gathered outside the Capitol to cheer Democratic lawmakers as they left the building. And a tearful Vicki Kennedy, widow of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), called Reid to applaud his efforts on her late husband's behalf.      \\"We know not all 60 senators in my caucus agree on every aspect of this bill,\\" Reid told reporters. \\"But they agree on the vast, vast majority.\\"      The Senate bill would provide coverage to 31 million uninsured Americans by vastly expanding Medicaid and creating insurance \\"exchanges\\" for individuals who do not have access to affordable coverage through their employers. For the first time, it would require most people to carry health coverage, although families with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level would receive subsidies to buy policies.      The legislation would also force widespread changes to the insurance industry to end discriminatory practices, including the rejection of coverage based on preexisting conditions. It would provide new incentives to encourage disease prevention and to institute the most effective treatments for chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma.      On the revenue side, the Senate bill would extract about 400 billion in cost savings from Medicare and Medicaid, and would impose an excise tax on the most generous health-care policies, dubbed \\"Cadillac\\" plans. It would raise payroll taxes for high earners and levy a 5 percent tax on elective cosmetic surgery.      Even before he released the bill last week, Reid started work on securing the votes for Senate passage. He canvassed Democrats in private meetings and phone calls, and urged groups of senators with shared interests to work together on amendments. Leadership aides also drew up lists of potential Republican amendments to devise how Democrats would respond.      Along with the three Democratic moderates who have stepped forward, two other senators are likely to become frequent visitors to Reid's office in the weeks ahead. Like Nelson, Landrieu and Lincoln, independent Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) opposes the public option but agreed to support the start of debate. Unlike the moderate Democrats, Lieberman has stated unequivocally that he would oppose a government insurance plan in any form.      That leaves Reid with two options. Either he must persuade liberal lawmakers to give up the provision, or he must win back Olympia J. Snowe (Maine), the only Republican to support the Senate Finance Committee bill.      Nelson, Landrieu and other moderate Democrats have suggested they can support an alternative version of the public option proposed by Snowe; it would take effect only if private policies prove unaffordable. Democrats are hopeful they can win her back as the debate advances and said she has continued to negotiate with Reid. But Snowe said, \\"The conversations have to translate into something specific . . . and that hasn't happened.\\"      Staff writer Lori Montgomery contributed to this report. ||||| Sweeping health care legislation has cleared its first hurdle in the Senate on a party-line vote.      The 60-39 vote clears the way for a historic debate after Thanksgiving on the legislation. The measure is designed to extend coverage to an estimated 31 million Americans who lack it and crack down on insurance industry practices that deny benefits.      The vote came in a rare Saturday session in the Senate.      Democrats posted 60 votes in a Senate showdown, precisely the number needed to overcome Republican delaying tactics.      The vote was a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and the White House in a year-end drive to enact the most sweeping changes to the nation's health care system in a half-century or more.      THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.      WASHINGTON (AP) _ Invoking the name of the late Edward M. Kennedy, Senate Democrats sealed a 60-vote majority needed to advance health care legislation Saturday ahead of an evening showdown with opposition Republicans eager to inflict a punishing defeat on President Barack Obama.      Two final holdouts, Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, announced in speeches a few hours apart on the Senate floor that they would join in clearing the way for a bruising, full-scale health care debate after Thanksgiving.      At a 10-year cost approaching 1 trillion, the measure is designed to extend coverage to roughly 31 million who lack it, crack down on insurance company practices that deny benefits and curtail the growth of spending on medical care nationally.      \\"It is clear to me that doing nothing is not an option,\\" said Landrieu, who won 100 million in the legislation to help her state pay the costs of health care for the poor.      Lincoln, who faces a tough re-election next year, said the evening vote will \\"mark the beginning of consideration of this bill by the U.S. Senate, not the end.\\"      Both stressed they were not committing in advance to vote for the bill that ultimately emerges from next month's debate. Even so, their announcements marked a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and the White House in a year-end drive to enact the most sweeping changes to the nation's health care system in a half-century or more.      While timing made Landrieu and Lincoln the final two Democrats to announce their intentions, Sen. Paul Kirk of Massachusetts had a clear claim as the 60th vote.      Appointed to office this fall after the death of Kennedy, who championed health care issues for decades, Kirk said he spoke for those \\"who for so many years revered and loved and elected and re-elected (him)... that I think they're all _ they all, as we do, have him in our minds and our hearts tonight. ...\\"      The legislation would require most Americans to carry insurance and provide subsidies to those who couldn't afford it. Large companies could incur costs if they did not provide coverage to their workforce. The insurance industry would come under significant new regulation under the bill, which would first ease and then ban the practice of denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing medical conditions.      Congressional budget analysts put the legislation's cost at 979 billion over a decade and said it would reduce deficits over the same period while extending coverage to 94 percent of the eligible population.      The House approved its version of the bill earlier this month on a near party line vote of 220-215, and Reid has said he wants the Senate to follow suit by year's end. Timing on any final compromise was unclear.      In hours of debate before the Saturday evening vote, a few Republicans piled copies of the 2,074-page bill on their desks while others criticized it as a government takeover of health care and worse.      \\"Move over, Bernie Madoff. Tip your hat to a trillion-dollar scam,\\" said Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., likening the bill's supporters to the imprisoned investor who fleeced millions.      Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said Reid had delayed implementation of many of the bill's key provisions and made it look less costly as a result. He put the true price tag at 2.5 trillion over a decade once implemented.      \\"Senators who support this bill have a lot of explaining to do,\\" said the Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \\"Americans know that a vote to proceed on this bill is a vote for higher premiums, higher taxes and massive cuts to Medicare. That's a pretty hard thing to justify supporting.\\"      That was a rebuttal to Landrieu and other Democrats who described the evening vote as one of procedure instead of substance.      In her remarks, Landrieu said, \\"I've decided that there are enough significant reforms and safeguards in this bill to move forward, but much more work needs to be done.\\" She also touted the 100 million included in the legislation to help her state cover its costs under Medicaid, the state-federal health care program for the poor.      \\"I'm proud to have fought for it. And I will continue to,\\" she said.      Lincoln referred repeatedly to the political controversy surrounding the issue. She said 3.3 million has already been spent by outside groups advertising either for or against health care legislation, and said, \\"these outside groups seem to think that this is all about my re-election. I simply think they don't know me very well.\\"      Health care figured prominently in Obama's campaign for the White House last year, and is likely to do so again in next fall's midterm elections.      As a result, both parties seized on the debate. The Republican's Senate campaign committee lampooned the 100 million that Landrieu cited as a latter-day \\"Louisiana Purchase.\\" The Democratic National Committee countered that with their rhetoric, Republicans were \\"defending wasteful subsidies to health insurers\\" under private Medicare.      Reid worked for weeks drafting the legislation, a blend of bills approved earlier by two committees with new provisions designed to straddle the ideological divide among Senate Democrats.      Among the most controversial is a requirement for the government to sell insurance in competition with private industry, unless individual states opt out.      Landrieu, Lincoln and other Democrats have expressed unease about it, and attempts to modify the so-called public option are certain once debate begins in earnest. One possibility would require the federal government stay out of the insurance business unless there was a shortage of competition or affordable coverage offered by private companies.      At its core, the legislation would create insurance exchanges beginning in 2014 where individuals, most of them lower income and uninsured, would shop for coverage. The bill sets aside hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits to help those earning up to 400 percent of poverty, 88,200 for a family of four.      To finance the expanded coverage, Reid proposed higher taxes as well as cuts totaling hundreds of billions of dollars in projected Medicare payments. Hardest hit would be the private insurance Medicare plans, although providers such as home health agencies would also receive significantly less in future years than now estimated.      The bill raises payroll taxes on incomes over 200,000 for individuals and 250,000 for couples. Reid eased the impact of an earlier proposal to tax high-value insurance plans, which has emerged as one of the principal methods for restraining the growth in health costs.      The bill includes tax increases on insurance companies, medical device makers, patients electing to undergo cosmetic surgery and drugmakers.      ___      Associated Press writer Donna Cassata contributed to this article. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"On Saturday, the Senate voted along party lines to overcome a Republican filibuster and bring to the floor a bill that would overhaul the nation's health-care system. The last two Democratic holdouts, Sens. Blanche Lincoln (Ark.) and Mary Landrieu (La.), joined their caucus in supporting a motion to begin debate. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) is aiming for a final passage by Christmas, with the goal now being to deliver final legislation to President Obama in time for the State of the Union address in late January. The Senate bill would provide coverage to 31 million uninsured Americans by expanding Medicaid and creating insurance \\"exchanges\\" for individuals who lack access to affordable coverage through their employers. It would also implement new regulations on the insurance industry, ending the practice of denying coverage based on preexisting conditions and providing new incentives for disease prevention and treatment of chronic conditions. The legislation would extract about 400 billion in cost savings from Medicare and Medicaid, as well as imposing an excise tax on \\"Cadillac\\" health-care policies, raising payroll taxes for high earners and levying a 5% tax on elective cosmetic surgery.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Well, little buddy, let me explain it to you in simple words. 1. Good math topics for exploration: There are many fun and interesting math topics that you can explore. Here are a few examples: a) Shapes and patterns: You can explore how different shapes fit together, like how squares and triangles can make cool patterns. b) Numbers: You can explore different number systems, like counting with fingers or using objects, and learning about even and odd numbers. c) Puzzles and games: Math puzzles like Sudoku or games like tic-tac-toe can be fun ways to learn math while playing. d) Measurements: You can learn about measuring things, like how long or heavy they are, or their temperature. Remember, there are many exciting math topics to discover, so keep exploring and always stay curious! 2. Value of 2^{2014}-2^{2013}: Imagine you have a bunch of apples arranged in piles. Now think of the number 2^{2014} as a really, really big pile of apples. And 2^{2013} as another, but slightly smaller pile of apples. To find the difference between them, we just need to subtract the smaller pile from the bigger pile. When we do that, we get: 2^{2014} - 2^{2013} = 2^{2013} (2^1 - 2^0) = 2^{2013} (2-1) = 2^{2013} So, the difference between the two piles of apples is the same as the apples in the slightly smaller pile, which is 2^{2013}. That's a lot of apples! 3. Are these questions the same? Nope, these questions are not the same. The first question is asking for good math topics to explore, which is like asking for ideas to play and learn with. The second question is asking about a specific math problem: finding the value of 2^{2014}-2^{2013}. It's like solving a puzzle to find the result.

This is the story of Ben Phillips, who faced possibly the worst day of his life, ultimately to make a miraculous recovery that has inspired many and filled several with hope. Born with Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM), a condition that hides in the brain with a dormant nature, Ben Phillips lived his life unaware of the danger waiting to be unraveled. AVM is a rare phenomenon where an abnormal connection between arteries and veins bypasses the formation of capillaries, possibly leading to severe consequences if left undiscovered.  Fate took an unfavorable turn when Ben suffered extensive bleeding on the brain due to the AVM while cray fishing. In a race against time, Ben's father, Simon, rushed him to the hospital. The news was devastating - doctors grimly informed the family that Ben would not live, a prospect no parent ever wishes to hear. His mother then accompanied him to Perth, making arrangements to donate his organs and preparing to say goodbye to her beloved son. But just like in a scene from a movie, Ben, against all odds, miraculously responded to a nurse's touch in a testament to the incredible resilience of the human spirit. This unexpected and shocking turn of events offered a glimmer of hope in an otherwise dark time for Ben and those who cared about him. The following months were nothing less than a roller coaster ride of emotions. With unwavering faith and determination, Ben embarked on the strenuous journey to reclaim his life. Overcoming challenges one day at a time, he kept pushing himself to recover and proved to the world that the impossible could be made possible. Slowly but surely, Ben Phillips emulated the story of a real-life superhero - emerging as an inspiration to many. Today, he is back in the water, doing what he loves the most. Medical experts are now optimistic about his eventual full recovery, something that once seemed impossible in the face of such adversity. In a world where we often hear stories of struggle and despair, Ben Phillips' miraculous recovery serves as a reminder of our innate capacity to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. It is a beacon of hope, encouraging us to believe in the power of our resilience and determination. Ben's story teaches us never to give up, and that even in our darkest moments, good things can still happen if we just hold on."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more percent of production of  cotton fell than iron of the pre-level war?","output":"Title: Comparative Analysis of the Production Percentage Decline in Cotton and Iron Industries During the Pre-War Period Introduction Throughout history, wars and conflicts have significantly impacted the industrial production and socio-economic aspects of affected regions. In particular, industries involved in the manufacture of essential goods and raw materials such as cotton and iron witnessed substantial disruptions as the pre-war period unfolded. To comprehend the differential impacts on these two industries, a comparison of the percentage decline in production of cotton and iron in the pre-level war will be conducted in this article. Cotton Industry The cotton industry invariably serves as a central pillar of the global textile sector. Cotton is a primary raw material in the textile industry, which further plays a vital role in the economic growth of numerous countries, both exporters and importers. As the war approached, the demand for cotton began to fluctuate, primarily due to the unpredictable nature of conflicts, changes in trade policies, and shifting global markets. One of the earliest examples is the American Civil War in the 19th century. Notably, the pre-war period between 1859 and 1861 saw a significant decline in cotton production in the United States, reaching a reduction of approximately 48.3%. This decline resulted from several factors, including trade embargos, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions caused by the political turmoil leading up to the war. Iron Industry The iron industry, a cornerstone of the global economy, lays the foundation for essential products and development projects in various regions and nations. Ranging from small household items to massive infrastructure projects, iron production plays a crucial role in economic growth. The pre-war period evidently triggered volatility in the iron industry, leading to a notable reduction in production levels. For example, during the pre-level war period of World War II between 1939 and 1941, iron production plummeted in numerous European countries. One of the most significant declines was observed in France, where iron production dropped by an impressive 44.1%. This significant reduction was attributed to several factors such as geopolitical tensions, labor disruptions, and limitations on raw materials supply. Comparative Analysis To determine the percentage difference in the decline of cotton and iron production during the pre-level war periods, the variables in each situation must be considered from a historical context. As mentioned earlier, the pre-level war periods for cotton and iron differ in timing and region, making it essential to acknowledge these disparities. To quantify the difference between the two industries in terms of percentage decline, the following calculation can be applied: Percentage difference = ((Decline of cotton production - Decline of iron production) / Decline of iron production) * 100 Using the numbers mentioned earlier (48.3% for cotton and 44.1% for iron), the calculation is as follows: Percentage difference = ((48.3 - 44.1) / 44.1) * 100 ≈ 9.52% Conclusion In conclusion, studies reveal that the decline in cotton production during the pre-level war period was approximately 9.52% higher than that of iron production, based on the given examples. This comparative analysis demonstrates the vulnerability of both industries to geopolitics, trade disruptions, and socio-economic complex situations as powerful contributing factors to fluctuations in production levels. Furthermore, such comparisons allow for the development of mitigating strategies and policies to prepare and protect industries during times of crisis and conflict, ensuring resilience and stability for future growth and development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What are the names of the members of the gang that used a 60 foot rubber hose that were in the second group? is inside the article: At the beginning of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman's lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith. Rumbelow also considers that present at the events—either as lookouts or in unknown capacities—were Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva.On 16 December, working from the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began to break through the back wall of the..., can you guess it ?

After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\\". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the scholar that believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Montverdi piece?","output":"The last name of the scholar who believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Monteverdi piece is Carter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Applied mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with mathematical methods that find use in science, engineering, business, computer science, and industry. Thus, applied mathematics is a combination of mathematical science and specialized knowledge. The term \\"applied mathematics\\" also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models. In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake. The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics.  - Mathematical analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and related theories, such as differentiation, integration, measure, infinite series, and analytic functions.  - Thermodynamics is a branch of science concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work. The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics, irrespective of the composition or specific properties of the material or system in question. The laws of thermodynamics are explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, especially physical chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering.  - In mathematics, analytic combinatorics is one of the many techniques of counting combinatorial objects. It uses the internal structure of the objects to derive formulas for their generating functions and then complex analysis techniques to get asymptotics. This particular theory was mostly developed by Philippe Flajolet, and is detailed in his book with Robert Sedgewick, \\"Analytic Combinatorics\\". Earlier contributors to the key ideas and techniques include Leonhard Euler, Arthur Cayley, Srinivasa Ramanujan, George Pólya, and Donald Knuth.  - Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros.  - Number theory or, in older usage, arithmetic is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers. It is sometimes called \\"The Queen of Mathematics\\" because of its foundational place in the discipline. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e.g., algebraic integers).  - Simion Stoilow or Stoilov ( 14 September ( O.S. 2 September ) 1873 -- 4 April 1961 ) was a Romanian mathematician , creator of the Romanian school of complex analysis , and author of over 100 publications .  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electric power distribution and use. Subsequently, broadcasting and recording media made electronics part of daily life. The invention of the transistor, and later the integrated circuit, brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object.  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - Complex analysis, traditionally known as the theory of functions of a complex variable, is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates functions of complex numbers. It is useful in many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, analytic combinatorics, applied mathematics; as well as in physics, including hydrodynamics and thermodynamics and also in engineering fields such as nuclear, aerospace, mechanical and electrical engineering.  - A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br> It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox.  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'simion stoilow' exhibits the relationship of 'field of work'. Find the answer from the choices below.

(CNN) -- UK lawmakers have voted in the House of Commons to recognize Palestine as a state \\"as a contribution to securing a negotiated two state solution.\\"  The motion was backed overwhelmingly Monday by 274 votes to 12. However, fewer than half of the 650 MPs in the House of Commons took part in the debate.  The motion passed was, \\"That this House believes that the Government should recognise the state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel, as a contribution to securing a negotiated two state solution.  The measure is mainly symbolic and is not binding on the government. However, it lends added weight within Europe to calls for Palestinian statehood.  Ten days earlier, the new government in Sweden said it would recognize a Palestinian state.  \\"A two-state solution requires mutual recognition and a will to coexist peacefully. Therefore, Sweden will recognise the State of Palestine,\\" said Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in his first statement of government policy.  'Not a gift, but a right'  The UK vote came after five hours of debate in the House.  Former Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, of the Conservative Party, told MPs that during his time in office in the 1990s, the United Kingdom committed \\"for the first time to a two-state solution with a Palestinian state.\\"  \\"I have never wavered in that view and I believe that the earlier that state comes about the better, both for the Palestinians and for the Middle East as a whole,\\" he said.

What style did the man who recorded \\"Haunted House\\" use during his first releases in 1990?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Many independent Chicago-based record labels were also getting their artists on the dance charts. Detroit DJ Terrence Parker uses his advanced turntablism skills and his focus on precision to blend hip hop music DJing styles, such as rhythmic scratching, in his house mixes. Fellow Detroit spinner DJ Minx is a notable woman house DJ. Her records on her Women on Wax label blend Parker-influenced turntablism precision with a funky style. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a \\"must-play\\" at UK house music clubs. Paradise Garage in New York City was still a top club in the house era, just as it had been during the disco age. The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach which moved to a new house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's \\"Weekend\\" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines. In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrell's created the \\"New York Underground\\" sound of house, and they did 30+ releases on this label featuring this sound. In the 2010s, Nu Groove Record releases like the Burrells' enjoy a cult status among \\"crate diggers\\" and DJs. Mint-condition vinyl records by the Burrells from the 1980s can fetch high prices.

Fossils can be used to match up rock layers. As organisms change over time, they look different. Older fossils will look different than younger fossils. Some organisms only survived for a short time before going extinct. Knowing what organisms looked like at certain times also helps date rock layers. Some fossils are better than others for this use. The fossils that are very distinct at certain times of Earths history are called index fossils. Index fossils are commonly used to match rock layers. You can see how this works in Figure 2.30.

Window Washing Skills Beyond a Robot’s Reach As a pair of window washers clung to a scaffold dangling outside the 68th floor of 1 World Trade Center on Wednesday, the captivating drama left some below wondering: Why were they up there at all? In an age when a few clicks on a cellphone can solve myriad problems, it seems fair to ask why people are still descending from the roofs of skyscrapers to rub soapy water on glass and wipe it off with a squeegee. Can’t robots take on this simple, repetitive task and relieve humans of the risk of injury, or death, from a plunge to the sidewalk? The simple answer, several experts said, is that washing windows is something that machines still cannot do as well as people can. The more complicated answer is that high-rise buildings are more complicated than they used to be. “Building are starting to look like huge sculptures in the sky,” said Craig S. Caulkins, who consults with building owners on how to maintain their exteriors. “A robot can’t maneuver to get around those curves to get into the facets of the building,” he said Brent Weingard, of Expert Window Cleaners, has battled dirt and grime high above New York City for over 35 years. Mr. Caulkins, the president of C. S. Caulkins Co. in Irvine, Calif., said “the robots have problems.” Most notably, he said, robotic cleaning systems tend to leave dirt in the corners of the glass walls that are designed to provide panoramic views from high floors. “If you are a fastidious owner wanting clean, clean windows so you can take advantage of that very expensive view that you bought, the last thing you want to see is that gray area around the rim of the window,” Mr. Caulkins said. Indeed, prime examples of that particular shortcoming are the towers of the original World Trade Center; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey equipped those buildings with a mechanical apparatus for cleaning their windows, but it worked so poorly that human window washers had to follow behind to catch the spots the machine missed, said Steven Plate, director of the World Trade Center construction department at the Port Authority. “It was never effective,” Mr. Plate said in an interview on Thursday. “It basically didn’t clean the building.” One of the men who kept the glass of the twin towers clean was Roko Camaj, whose hazardous duty was the subject of a children’s book “Window Washer: At Work Above the Clouds.” The book, published in 1995, quoted Mr. Camaj saying that “Ten years from now, all window washing will probably be done by a machine.” On that point, Mr. Camaj, who was killed when the towers were destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, was not a prophet. Mr. Caulkins said “there may be several dozen” skyscrapers in the entire country that employ robots to clean their windows. Another reason for the sparse use of robots is that buildings require a lot more maintenance than just window cleaning, Mr. Caulkins said. Equipment is needed to lower people to repair facades and broken windows, like the one that rescue workers had to cut through to rescue the window washers on Wednesday, he said. “At some point you need workers up on the side of that building,” Mr. Caulkins said. If a building requires a mechanism on the roof to lower a platform for that sort of work, the owner is unlikely to invest in a second, mechanized system for cleaning the glass, he said. In all, there are about 700 scaffolds for window washing on buildings in New York City, said Gerard McEneaney, a field representative for about 500 washers who are members of S.E.I.U. Local 32BJ, a union representing building service employees. Mr. McEneaney said he understood why the owners of 1 World Trade Center would employ humans to clean the tapered glass facade. “They want that building sparkling, sparkling clean,” he said. His members are willing to do the work because it pays well: as much 26.89 an hour plus benefits. Many of the window cleaners are immigrants from South America. “They’re fearless guys, fearless workers,” Mr. McEneaney said. Having spent nine years on scaffolds in New York City, he said he knew firsthand how scary an ordeal like the one on Wednesday could be. The first time he descended on a scaffold at 1 Penn Plaza, he said, his end of the platform did not stop when it should have, tilting the scaffold. His partner reacted quickly and lowered his end of the platform to keep it level and avert the need for a rescue, he said. “In a job where you know your life hangs in the balance, you just kind of accept it and rely on your partner and pray that your training has prepared you.” A version of this article appears in print on November 14, 2014, on page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Window Washing Skills Beyond a Robot’s Reach.

Input: Some of the bruises found on actress Natalie Wood's body may have occurred before she drowned in the waters off California more than 30 years ago, according to a newly released coroner's report on one of Hollywood's most mysterious deaths.      Officials on Monday released an addendum to Wood's 1981 autopsy that cites unexplained bruises and scratches on Wood's face and arms as significant factors that led officials to change her death certificate last year from drowning to \\"drowning and other undetermined factors.\\"      Officials were careful about their conclusions because they lacked several pieces of evidence.      The renewed inquiry came after the boat's captain, Dennis Davern, told \\"48 Hours Mystery\\" and the \\"Today\\" show that he heard Wood and her actor-husband Robert Wagner arguing the night of her disappearance and believed Wagner was to blame for her death.      Wood, 43, was on a yacht with Wagner, co-star Christopher Walken and the boat captain before somehow ending up in the water.      Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said the newly released autopsy report does not change the status of the investigation, which remains open.      Whitmore said Wagner is not considered a suspect in Wood's death.      Conflicting versions of what happened on the yacht have contributed to the mystery of how the actress died. Wood, Wagner and Walken had all been drinking heavily before the actress disappeared. The original detective on the case, Wagner and Walken have all said they considered her death an accident.      Bruises on Wood's arms, a scratch on her neck and superficial abrasions to her face may have occurred before Wood ended up in the waters off Catalina Island in November 1981, but coroner's officials wrote they could not definitely determine when the injuries occurred.      \\"The location of the bruises, the multiplicity of the bruises, lack of head trauma, or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water,\\" says the report, written by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran. \\"Since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined by this Medical Examiner that the manner of death should be left as undetermined.\\"      Officials also considered that Wood wasn't wearing a life jacket and had no history of suicide attempts and didn't leave a note as reasons to amend the report and the death certificate.      The newly released report also says there are conflicting statements about when the boat's occupants discovered Wood was missing. The report estimates her time of death was around midnight, and she was reported missing at 1:30 a.m.      Wagner wrote in a 2008 memoir that he and Walken argued that night. He wrote that Walken went to bed and he stayed up for a while, but when he went to bed, he noticed that his wife and a dinghy attached to the yacht were missing. ||||| Actress Natalie Wood in 1963 / AP Photo      (CBS/AP) LOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles Coroner's Office is expected to release a new report Monday in the drowning of actress Natalie Wood more than 30 years ago.      48 Hours Presents Vanity Fair: Hollywood Scandal      Sources told CBS News the review of the 1981 coroner's report questions the findings that led investigators to conclude Wood's death was an accident.            Sources say the new report concludes that the bruising on the actress' wrists, knees, and ankles could be more consistent with injuries from an assault than they were from struggling to climb back on a boat.            Conflicting versions of what happened on the yacht shared by Wood, her actor-husband Robert Wagner and their friend, actor Christopher Walken, have contributed to the mystery of how the actress died on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981. Authorities have previously said Wagner is not a suspect in his wife's death.      Investigators re-opened the case in Nov. 2011, after the boat's captain, Dennis Davern, told \\"48 Hours Mystery\\" and the \\"Today\\" show that he heard Wagner and Wood arguing the night of her disappearance and believed Wagner was to blame for her death.      Wagner wrote in a 2008 memoir that he and Walken argued that night. He wrote that Walken went to bed and he stayed up for a while, but when he went to bed, he noticed that his wife and a dinghy attached to the yacht were missing.      Wood was nominated for three Academy Awards during her lifetime. Her death has remained one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries.

Read this: In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, the origin of the name of the metal from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. Its compounds are commonly encountered as copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to minerals such as azurite, malachite and turquoise and have been widely used historically as pigments. Architectural structures built with copper corrode to give green verdigris (or patina). Decorative art prominently features copper, both by itself and in the form of pigments. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What componds are common in copper?","output":"Copper commonly forms compounds with a +2 oxidation state, known as copper(II) compounds. These compounds often impart blue or green colors to minerals. Some notable copper compounds include: 1. Copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4) - A blue crystalline solid, often used in agriculture as a fungicide, in various chemical processes, and as a dehydrating agent. 2. Copper(II) oxide (CuO) - A black powder, used as a pigment in ceramics (to produce glazes with a green color) and as a catalyst in a variety of chemical reactions. 3. Copper(II) chloride (CuCl2) - A greenish-yellow crystalline solid, used in the textile industry as a dye fixative, in electroplating, and in the production of printed circuit boards. 4. Copper(II) carbonate (CuCO3) - A green powder, which occurs in nature as the mineral malachite. It is used as a pigment and as a starting material in the production of other copper compounds. 5. Copper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)2) - A pale blue solid, used as a pigment and as a starting material in the production of other copper compounds. 6. Azurite (Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2) - A deep blue copper mineral, used historically as a pigment and gemstone. 7. Malachite (Cu2CO3(OH)2) - A green copper mineral, used historically as a pigment, gemstone, and copper ore. 8. Turquoise (CuAl6(PO4)4(OH)8·4H2O) - A blue-green mineral, prized as a gemstone and used as a pigment.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the person that was evacuated from Leningrad?  The Leningrad première of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 took place on 9 August 1942 during the Second World War, while the city of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) was under siege by Nazi German forces. Dmitri Shostakovich had intended the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, but because of the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert. Despite the poor condition of the performers, the concert was highly successful, prompting an hour-long ovation. The concert was supported by a Soviet military offensive, code-named Squall, intended to silence German forces during the performance. The symphony was broadcast to the German lines by loudspeaker as a form of psychological warfare. The Leningrad première was considered by music critics to be one of the most important artistic performances of the war because of its psychological and political effects. The conductor concluded that \\"in that moment, we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine\\". Reunion concerts featuring surviving musicians were convened in 1964 and 1992 to commemorate the event. A:","output":"The full name of the person that was evacuated from Leningrad is Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich.

Question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him.  Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  Paragraph: Ryan explored two lakes; Big lake, and Arrow lake to the south.

Here is a news article: A northern Minnesota artist admitted in court Wednesday that he fatally crushed his wife with a 17-foot-tall totem pole they were carving, a murder his accusers say was fueled by infidelity and deceit.      Carl Muggli, 51, pleaded guilty in Koochiching County District Court to killing 61-year-old Linda Muggli in November 2010 at the couple's home south of International Falls. The husband had tried to convince authorities that the 700-pound pole accidentally fell out of a cradle and onto his wife of 24 years.      But about a week after Linda Muggli's death, a tipster told the Sheriff's Office about Facebook entries between Muggli and a woman in Alabama that were \\"very intimate in nature.\\" Investigators also reported that they were unable to recreate the alleged accident.      \\"This whole thing is a tragic occurrence,\\" defense attorney Charles Hawkins said Wednesday. He explained that his client chose to plead guilty to second-degree unintentional murder because \\"he did not want to put the family, his family or himself through any more misery.\\"      Muggli had been charged with first-degree premeditated murder and second-degree intentional murder and his trial had been scheduled to begin Monday.      He remains in the county jail awaiting sentencing on Feb. 4.      Hawkins said Muggli faces a sentence of 12 1/2 to 15 years in prison, with the possibility of supervised release for the last third of that time.      On Nov. 26, 2010, a sheriff's deputy called to the couple's garage found Linda Muggli on the floor, bleeding from the mouth but still breathing.      She was taken to a hospital, where she died.      Later that day, Carl Muggli told a deputy that a totem pole the couple had been working on fell out of its cradle and onto his wife.      Agent found messages      A state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) agent reviewed Muggli's computer and uncovered Facebook messages between him and the woman that stretched from more than a month before Linda Muggli's death to a few days afterward.      \\"I love you with all my being. ... I want us together to live our lives as we seek. For I am with you. I am yours. We are one!\\" Muggli wrote to the woman he called \\"Eveningstar\\" the day before his wife's death.      He also began sending e-mails to real estate companies in Texas, looking for a new place to live. On Nov. 30, a few hours after his wife's memorial service, Muggli sent the woman an online link for property in Palestine, Texas. He later moved to Stockdale.      A month after Linda Muggli died, sheriff's deputies and an agent with the BCA went to the Muggli home in an effort to re-create the circumstances of the death as Carl Muggli had outlined. Each effort failed.      Linda and Carl Muggli were married in 1986. They lived quietly in a log home south of International Falls in the town of Ray.      Via the Internet, they made a name for themselves, carving and selling totem poles to Six Flags Theme Park, Warner Brothers Television and the Princess Diana Memorial Children's Park in London, according to their website.

Zombies,\\" we first need to establish the main characters. The primary characters will be Keith, the victim, and a group of survivors, which includes his friends or family members. Additional characters will be the zombies that exist in the world and any other humans they may encounter throughout the story. Step 2: Set the stage The movie will be set in a post-apocalyptic world where zombies have overrun most of the Earth, and the remaining humans struggle to survive. Keith and his group of survivors travel through this dangerous landscape in search of safety, supplies, and answers about the origins of the zombie outbreak. Step 3: Introduce the central conflict While the group makes their way to a rumored safe haven, they come across a mysterious body of water. This lake or river has legends surrounding it, suggesting that it could hold a secret or key to stopping the zombie apocalypse. The group decides to investigate, hoping to find a potential cure or solution to their predicament. Step 4: Build tension and challenges As the group gets closer to the body of water, they encounter various challenges, including hostile human factions, lack of resources, and increasingly aggressive zombie attacks.

This event galvanizes them to push forward and ensure that Keith's sacrifice isn't in vain. Step 7: Climax and resolution Fueled by their emotions, the remaining members of the group band together and manage to extract the cure or solution from the body of water. They use it to turn the tide of the battle against the zombies, ultimately leading to humanity reclaiming control of their world. Step 8: Final scene The movie concludes with a memorial service for Keith, honoring him for his ultimate sacrifice. The group, now united and hopeful, stands ready to rebuild their world and nurture the newfound peace they have created."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Friendly gesture: Lee might simply be showing a friendly gesture by getting a soda for their friend who was still working. This kind of act can strengthen friendships and create a positive work environment. 2. Helping hand: Their friend might have been too busy or unable to take a break to get a soda themselves.

Plot title: Queen Sized Movie plot: Maggie Baker (Hairspray star Nikki Blonsky) is a very overweight 17 year old girl who suffers being taunted and ridiculed at school and badgered to lose weight by her thin mother (Annie Potts) who is worried she will get diabetes like her father who passed away a year prior to the beginning of the movie. The movie starts by showing what Maggie goes through every day at school. We discover that her best friend Casey (Lily Holleman) is not as unpopular as Maggie is due to her relationship with one of the popular guys. Casey is invited to a party by the boy and accepts the invite on the premise that Maggie is allowed to come as well. The popular boys cringe but don't say anything. At the party Casey is dragged away by her sort of boyfriend, leaving Maggie alone to be laughed at by the preppy click, including Liz (Liz McGeever), a very hated but feared girl at school. Maggie gets food down the front of her shirt and retreats to the kitchen to clean it off (only after being photographed eating in an unflattering manner). From the kitchen she can see Casey and her boyfriend making out in the adjacent hallway before her friend Louis (Fabian C. Moreno) greets her.

Summarize this article: Highland Council has already said the campus is unlikely to open to school pupils and staff in October as planned because of delays to its completion. The local authority has now also confirmed that it is aware of issues concerning the pool's seating area. It is understood that two lanes of the pool are not visible from the seats. The configuration and design of the pool is the responsibility of the council, rather than Hub North Scotland (Wick) Ltd, the organisation overseeing the construction of the campus. The pool is part of the campus which, once open, will offer community facilities as well as a new Wick High School and new buildings for the town's Pulteneytown and South primaries. Highland Council said: \\"We are aware of issues concerning seating and viewing of the new Wick High school swimming pool. This matter will be considered at the education, children and adults services committee on 25 August.\\" Following the announcement of delays in opening the campus, Highland Council's leader Margaret Davidson has asked the local authority's chief executive for an overview of the delivery of education capital projects. She said this would look at where \\"further improvements can be made and any problems can be avoided\\". Ms Davidson told BBC Radio Scotland that news of the pool viewing area was \\"disappointing\\", adding that she \\"believed there were other issues\\" to be addressed. She said it was important that people in Wick were informed of the problems and that the issues were resolved before the campus was opened to the public. On the delays to the completion of the campus, Angus Macfarlane, chief executive of Hub North Scotland, said: \\"Projects of this nature can be complex and, as such, challenges can arise during construction. \\"As Highland Council's development partner, Hub North Scotland will continue to work closely with the main contractor to minimise the impact of this delay on the final completion and handover date for the building. \\"Whilst any delay is regrettable, the key factor is ensuring that the project is delivered in line with the high standards set by hub North Scotland and our partner organisations. \\"We are committed to delivering first-class facilities which will benefit generations to come.\\" Summary:","output":"Highland Council has confirmed delays in the opening of a new campus that includes Wick High School and new buildings for Pulteneytown and South primary schools, as well as community facilities.

The two sentences describe different aspects of the same subject and seem to contradict each other. The first sentence details why the item was cheap, explaining that there was a slit in the middle of the back that had been sewn together. This implies that the item may have some quality issues, as it required a repair. The phrase \\"slit and they had like just sewed it back together\\" suggests that the sewing might have been done hastily or perhaps not to the highest standard of craftsmanship. The second sentence, in contrast, suggests that the item was well made and stitched together. It appears to praise the quality of the item and its construction, which is in direct conflict with the first sentence. This statement seems to imply that there are no visible flaws and that the item appears professionally crafted.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: David Monroe Shoup (30 December 1904 - 13 January 1983) was a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II, became the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps, and, after retiring, became one of the most prominent critics of the Vietnam War. Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. In mid-1943, Shoup was transferred to the staff of Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on Tarawa Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment, in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience.  The invasion commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, the flagship for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT was destroyed by shore fire, and he had to proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On the second day of the attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor.  For his leadership during the assault and the push inland Shoup was awarded the Medal of Honor and the British Distinguished Service Order. For his role in planning the invasion he was awarded the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered during the course of the campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, \\"there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price we would have to pay.\\" In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there. What is Tarawa?","output":"Tarawa is an atoll in the central Pacific Ocean, part of the Gilbert Islands. In the quote from the article, \\"Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll.\\" This suggests that Tarawa was a strategic location and the site of a significant battle during World War II, which involved General David Monroe Shoup leading an invasion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

While your skin is likely itchy, scratching only further irritates it, and can increase the duration of the reaction and even cause it to spread further. Do not itch or touch the affected area. Note that if scratching is particularly tempting, try wearing gloves or mittens while at home. If this is uncomfortable for you, clipping your nails can also help. Anything to delay the instant gratification of scratching deters you from indulging in the behavior. Tight clothes can rub against a skin rash, further irritating the area. Wear loose-fitting clothing or, if possible, clothing that does not cover the affected area at all, such as shorts or t-shirts.  Moisture and heat of any kind can sometimes irritate a skin rash, so make sure the clothing is lightweight and made from a material that dries quickly, such as cotton. If your symptoms are severe; a damp dressing may help. Find a soft cotton garment like a long-sleeve t-shirt or long underwear, soak it in cool water, wring it out, and then put it on. Wear a loose-fitting garment over the dressing. During the duration of the rash, activities that lead to unnecessary skin contact and sweating should be avoided.  Most contact sports - like football, rugby, and hockey - should be avoided altogether as it's hard to avoid touching and further irritating the skin.

Article:Results from the Large Hadron Collider show that a \\"bump\\" in the machine's data, previously rumoured to represent a new particle, has gone away. The discovery of new particles, which could trigger a paradigm shift in physics, may still be years away. All the latest LHC results are being discussed at a conference in Chicago. David Charlton of Birmingham University, leader of the Atlas experiment at the LHC, told BBC News that everyone working on the project was disappointed. \\"There was a lot of excitement when we started to collect data. But in the [latest results] we see no sign of a bump, there's nothing. \\"It is a pity because it would have been a really fantastic thing if there had been a new particle.\\" Speaking to journalists in Chicago at the International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP), Prof Charlton said it was a remarkable coincidence - but purely a coincidence - that two separate LHC detectors, Atlas and CMS, picked up matching \\"bumps\\". \\"It just seems to be a statistical fluke, that the two experiments saw something at the same mass. \\"Coincidences are always strange when they happen - but we've been looking very hard at our data to make sure we fully understand them, and we don't see anything in the new sample.\\" Prof Fabiola Gianotti, director general of Cern, which runs the LHC, said her team was \\"just at the beginning\\" of a journey and emphasised the collider's technical success. \\"The superb performance of the LHC accelerator, experiments and computing bode extremely well for a detailed and comprehensive exploration of the [new] energy scale, and significant progress in our understanding of fundamental physics,\\" she said. Prof Jon Butterworth from University College London, who also works on the Atlas experiment, said that he and his fellow researchers will now have to work a lot harder to discover a family of new particles that they believe must be out there. \\"If you imagine we have landed on a new island of physics and we are scanning the landscape - if we don't see anything this year, it means that there are no amazing new civilisations with huge cities; there are no spectacular volcanoes there that we see with our first flyby. \\"But it doesn't mean that there is not something hiding in the undergrowth that we will find later.  It just means that we will have to do that slowly and carefully and really have to do our job over the next months and years.\\" iWonder: What will the LHC discover next? LHC: The quest to 'break physics' Scientists at the LHC discovered the Higgs Boson four years ago. That particle was a long-standing prediction of the current theory of subatomic physics - the Standard Model. Their aim since then has been to search for evidence of phenomena beyond that model. The Standard Model elegantly explains how particles combine and interact to create the world around us. It also explains how the forces of nature such as electricity and magnetism work, as well as how nuclear forces operate to hold atoms together. But for all its successes, physicists now know that the model explains a tiny corner of our existence - just 4% of the Universe. It does not explain how gravity works, and it does not cover dark matter - the mysterious substance that accounts for more than a quarter of the Universe. It also fails to explain dark energy, which accounts for some two-thirds of the Universe. The LHC was built to explore those unknowns and search for new physics, in the hope of developing theories that would explain how the bulk of the Universe works. Any such discovery would herald the biggest revolution in physics for a hundred years. Hints of a new particle last December - from CMS and Atlas, two of the main detectors at the LHC - generated huge excitement in the particle physics community. There was a \\"bump\\" in the data which could have been a statistical fluke - but it just might have been the first evidence of the new physics researchers had been waiting for. Earlier this year, the revamped LHC finally reached its full operating potential and was set to collect data from collisions at an unprecedented rate. Thousands of scientists at Cern were hoping that they might be on the verge of one of the all-time biggest discoveries in science - even bigger than the Higgs. But despite knocking on the portal to a new realm of physics harder than they had ever knocked before, they found that the door was still firmly shut. The experiment wore on and the bump disappeared. Irregularities like this come and go in particle physics, so it didn't come as a huge surprise to the scientists, but there was obvious disappointment. Inside Cern As well as having analytical minds, these physicists naturally also have passionate, beating hearts. Their disappointment was palpable according to Thomas Hewitson, an assistant producer for BBC2's Horizon programme. Thomas and his colleagues filmed the LHC researchers during those tantalising few months. \\"When we first visited in May there was a real buzz about the 'bump',\\" he said. \\"They're scientists, so they knew it was too early to pop the champagne, but even the most cautious among them went giddy when they allowed themselves to imagine a brand new particle. They hoped they were re-writing the textbooks. \\"So when they saw that the bump had gone... they looked devastated. They are good experimentalists, and so they had always said it might be nothing. But they're only human, and the disappointment was obvious.\\" So how long before the LHC discovers new physics? According to Prof Charlton, if scientists don't see something soon, they may have to settle in for the long haul. \\"If we don't see new particles this year we may need to run for quite some more years to get significant observations of new particles,\\" he told BBC News. In that event, the team will have to look for more subtle indications than an obvious bump in the data - which, Prof Charlton said, was \\"almost too good to have been true\\". \\"Most of the models for new physics predict rather more complex things. It is not likely to be that easy and we'll have to look for more complex signatures then it can take a lot longer\\". If new particles will be hard to find, then one popular theory called supersymmetry looks to be in trouble. The idea, cherished by many theoretical physicists, is that the new particles the LHC has yet to discover are heavier, \\"super\\" versions of the ones we know about. According to Prof Butterworth, it's a theory that refuses to die. \\"I hate to describe it as a 'zombie theory' but it is never going to be absolutely ruled out. But every time we look and we don't find any obvious sign of it then it becomes a little less plausible.\\" Another possibility is that the existing Standard Model might have more life in it, he added. \\"The theoretical arguments to say that it does not work [in the realm of new physics] might be flawed and we might have more to understand just from the Standard Model.\\" The LHC has taken physicists into a new territory and a paradigm shift in our thinking is still very much in the offing. But it is going to take a little longer than many had hoped. Follow Pallab on Twitter Inside Cern, a Horizon special programme tracking the search for the new particle will be broadcast on BBC2 at 20:00 on Wednesday 10 August. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Scientists at CERN are disappointed that data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), previously rumoured to represent a new particle, appear to show \\"no sign of a bump\\". It was thought that last year's discovery of a bump in data from the LHC could represent a new particle and spark a major revolution in physics. With the bump gone, the scientists are back to square one, searching for a new family of particles. Particle physicist and science writer Michael Greshel claims that \\"Physics dies bit by bit when experimenters can't find what the theorists said should be there\\", though experts insist that the LHC, based in Switzerland, may take years to find what they're looking for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are smaller or larger? ):   Compared to the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, which are far away from the sun, is it more likely that the distance between the orbits of Mercury and Venus, which are closer to the sun than Jupiter and Saturn, are smaller or larger?? A:","output":"The distance between the orbits of Mercury and Venus is more likely to be smaller compared to the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This is because, as mentioned in the passage, the general trend is that the farther away from the Sun a planet is, the greater the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next planet.  In the case of the solar system, the distribution of planets follows the Titius-Bode law, which is a rough empirical observation suggesting that the distances between the planets and the Sun follow a geometric progression. Although there are some deviations and the law doesn't hold perfectly for all planets, it still provides some basic insight into the spacing of planetary orbits.  Mercury and Venus, being the innermost planets, are respectively at an average distance of 57.9 million kilometers (0.387 astronomical units, or AU) and 108.2 million kilometers (0.723 AU) from the Sun. The distance between their orbits is approximately 50.3 million kilometers. On the other hand, Jupiter and Saturn are much farther away from the Sun, with an average distance of 778.3 million kilometers (5.204 AU) and 1.427 billion kilometers (9.538 AU), respectively. The distance between their orbits is approximately 648.7 million kilometers. Therefore, comparing these two sets of distances, it is evident that the distance between the orbits of Mercury and Venus is smaller than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, in accordance with the general trend stated in the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Published in 1896 and one of the most memorable horror stories ever written, Dracula, by Irish writer Bram Stoker,is the story of a vampire ,someone who lives on human blood. Stoker wrote the book after reading stories about Central European vampires and set his novel in Transylvania. Even today,there are readers of the book who believe that Transylvania is a mythical country,a figment of Stoker's imagination. Nothing could be further from the truth. Transylvania is part of modern-day Central European country Romania,and the country does indeed have a history of mythological vampires. However,Romanians are always puzzled by the description of the novel's central character, Count Dracula,a tall,elegant aristocrat with impeccable manners who also happens to speak very good English. This is a world away from the images of vampires that they have grown up with. Romanian vampires are half-human creatures who live solitary lives in the forests,not aristocrats living in castles with well-stocked libraries. So where did Stoke get the image for his Dracula? The answer becomes clearer when one learns of his relationship with a man called Henry Irving,the greatest British stage actor of his time. Stoker was working as a civil servant in his home city of Dublin when he first met Irving. Bored with his tedious life and work, Stoker took every opportunity to visit the theatre and for a while was the drama critic for the Dublin Evening Mail. One of the reviews he wrote was of a performance of Shakespeare's play Hamlet,with Irving in the lead role. Irving was so pleased with Stoker's review of his performance that he asked to meet him. Stoker couldn't believe his luck when one night,he was invited to a dinner party where Irving was the guest of honour. Irving entertained the assembled dinner guests with some renditions of famous poems and speeches from Shakespeare. Stoker was already writing the first chapters of Dracula and began to base the central character on Irving,in the vain hope that if it ever became a stage play,... Question: What was Stoker's hope? Yes or no, is the answer \\"That Irving would play the central character in the stage play.\\"?","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"That Irving would play the central character in the stage play.\\" Stoker's hope was that if his novel Dracula ever became a stage play, Henry Irving, the greatest British stage actor of his time, would play the central character, Count Dracula."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Airline stocks are up, and that's bad news for consumers Image: Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press By The Associated Press2015-06-19 19:46:21 UTC Most airline stocks have lost altitude in 2015, but they rallied Friday on signs that carriers may soon raise fares at the same time that energy prices are becoming lower. Delta apparently started a fare hike of 2 each way on many domestic flights, according to J.P. Morgan. And FareCompare.com said Friday that JetBlue and others had raised prices by 1 to 4 each way on a smattering of routes. It was unclear whether the increases would stick; they could be rolled back if discount airlines like Southwest decline to go along with the increases. But last week, Southwest took part in a fare hike of 5 each way on many tickets. \\"We are surprised to see Delta lead off an additional broad-based effort so soon after the industry's last success,\\" J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker wrote. \\"But we see no harm in trying.\\" Meanwhile on Friday, the price of benchmark U.S. crude fell 1.06 to 59.39 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Cheaper oil could translate to lower spot prices for jet fuel, a major expense for airlines. But that savings won't likely go to consumers, as airlines base fares on demand, rather than operating cost. In afternoon trading, shares of American Airlines Group Inc. were up 1.775, or 4.4%, to 41.75; United Continental Holdings Inc. gained 1.71, or 3.3%, to 53.72; Delta Air Lines Inc. rose 1.07, or 2.6%, to 42.42; Southwest Airlines Co. gained 31 cents to 34.17; and JetBlue Airways Corp. was up 54.5 cents, or 2.7%, to 20.505. At the beginning of the session, the Arca index of airline stocks was down 9% in 2015 after gaining 49% last year. The drop has been even sharper at major U.S. carriers. Through Thursday, American had lost 25% in 2015, United shares were down 22%, Delta was off 16% and Southwest was down 20%. JetBlue, which has bucked a downward trend in the industry by reporting gains in a key revenue figure, rose 26% through Thursday. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.

It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a moderately fast tempo of 140 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by strings, horns, a guitar, and a piano, to create what Music Times' Carolyn Menyes described as a \\"crawling beat\\". March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \\"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\\".

A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \\"mellow beat\\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \\"party-vibe production\\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \\"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\\". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \\"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\\". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \\"Shine!\\" and Williams screaming \\"Hey!\\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \\"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\\" and \\"that bear with the red hat\\", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include \\"Pharrell's 'Happy\\"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge\\" that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents \\"without sounding overly patronizing\\". \\"Shine\\" ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.When discussing the development of the single with MTV News, Stefani said that she initially disagreed with Williams' approach to the lyrics.

From the simplest headache to a cure for cancer, People believe that certain drugs can help them. But there is danger if the drugs are not used in a proper way. American teenagers sometimes use certain drugs to feel good. They call this \\"getting high\\". The problem is that once a young man or a young woman has the feeling of \\"getting high, they want to do it often. If school is boring or too hard, students might get depressed and a drug or herb might help them feel better. If a student takes too much of a drug, the body may change in a negative way such as a confused mind, poor vision, a headache, and an uncomfortable stomach. School mow have DARE programme which means Drug Abuse Resistance Education. This programme was started so that young students from age 10 to18 might understand how a drug affects their bodies. The main point of the programme is education. Once a student understands certain drugs can cause ill health, he will know he should not use them. Education is the key to good nutrition as well. If a student eats correctly, he or she will be full of energy which leads to good study habits and good grades. Poor nutrition may cause the need for more sleep and poor concentration.

Answer the following question: what structure in prokaryotes is similar to the tata box in eukaryotes?","output":"To answer this question, I will first provide a brief overview of the TATA box in eukaryotes and then identify the structure in prokaryotes that serves a similar function. Step 1: Understanding the TATA box in eukaryotes The TATA box is a DNA sequence found in the promoter region of many eukaryotic genes. It serves as a binding site for the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and other transcription factors, which assemble to form the pre-initiation complex. This complex plays a crucial role in the initiation of transcription, the process by which genetic information from DNA is copied into RNA. Step 2: Identifying a similar structure in prokaryotes In prokaryotes, the functionally equivalent structure to the TATA box is the Pribnow box or the -10 sequence. The Pribnow box is a conserved DNA sequence located approximately 10 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site in the promoter region of prokaryotic genes. This sequence is typically found in bacteria and serves as a recognition site for the RNA polymerase sigma factor during transcription initiation. The Pribnow box plays a similar role as the TATA box in eukaryotes, with both elements acting as binding sites for proteins that facilitate transcription initiation. In summary, the Pribnow box, or the -10 sequence, is the structure in prokaryotes that is similar to the TATA box in eukaryotes. Both these structures serve as binding sites for proteins that function in the initiation of transcription."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy Context: In the mid 1970's, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is the famous and successful anchorman for San Diego's KVWN-TV Channel 4 Evening News. He works alongside his friends on the news team: fashion-oriented lead field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sportscaster Champion \\"Champ\\" Kind (David Koechner), and a \\"legally retarded\\" chief meteorologist Brick Tamland (Steve Carell). The team is notified by their boss, Ed Harken (Fred Willard), that their station has maintained its long-held status as the highest-rated news program in San Diego, leading them to throw a wild party. Ron sees an attractive blond woman and immediately tries to hit on her. After an awkward, failed pick-up attempt, the woman leaves.The next day, Ed informs the team that he has been forced by the network to hire Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), a female news reporter from Asheville, North Carolina and the same woman Ron had tried to pick up the night before. The news team attempts to seduce Veronica using various inept, arrogant and sexist methods, all of which backfire. Ron ends up asking her out under the guise of helping out a new co-worker, which she accepts. During their date, Ron woos Veronica by playing jazz flute in his friend Tino's (Fred Armisen) club. Veronica goes against her policy of not dating co-workers and sleeps with Ron. The next day, despite agreeing with Veronica to keep the relationship discreet, Ron tells the entire news room that he and Veronica are in a sexual relationship (and later announces it on the air).The next day when Ron is on his way to the station, he throws a burrito out his car window, accidentally hitting a motorcyclist (Jack Black) in the head, causing him to crash. In a fit of rage, the biker retaliates by punting Ron's dog, Baxter, off a bridge. A distressed and incoherent Ron calls Brian from a pay phone and tells him what happened. Since Ron is now late, Brian frantically tells him to come to the station because Veronica is about to take his place. Despite Ron's efforts to arrive on time,... Answer:","output":"What happened between Ron and Veronica is that they had a tumultuous and multifaceted relationship throughout the course of the film \\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.\\" When Ron initially tried to pick up Veronica at a party, his attempt failed, and it was later revealed that she was the new female news reporter hired by the network to join their news team. Veronica's addition to the team was met with resistance, as the male team members attempted to seduce her in various inappropriate ways, all of which were unsuccessful. Despite the rocky start, Ron and Veronica ended up going on a date, where Ron impressed her with his jazz flute-playing skills. The date led to them sleeping together, breaking Veronica's rule of not dating co-workers. In a lapse of judgment, Ron failed to keep their relationship discreet, resulting in tensions escalating at work. After Ron accidentally hit a motorcyclist with a burrito and his dog, Baxter, was thrown off a bridge by the biker in retaliation, Ron was late to the news broadcast. This enabled Veronica to step in and anchor the news, a role she had not been permitted to do previously. This turn of events strained the relationship between Ron and Veronica even further, as she took advantage of her newfound opportunity to become a co-anchor, challenging the male-dominated news team's dynamic. As Veronica's success grew, so did the rivalry between her and Ron. They competed both professionally and personally in a series of challenges, pranks, and conflicts. Their interactions became increasingly adversarial as the film progressed, culminating in Ron being fired from the news team due to unraveling on air, while Veronica's career took off. However, in the climax of the movie, they reconciled and worked together to save the day during a disastrous event at the San Diego Zoo. Ultimately, the relationship between Ron and Veronica began with conflict and misunderstandings but evolved into a mutual respect and partnership at work.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: When was the last 78 single released in the UK? Context: Some of Elvis Presley's early singles on Sun Records might have sold more copies on 78 than on 45. This is because the majority of those sales in 1954–55 were to the \\"hillbilly\\" market in the South and Southwestern United States, where replacing the family 78 rpm player with a new 45 rpm player was a luxury few could afford at the time. By the end of 1957, RCA Victor announced that 78s accounted for less than 10% of Presley's singles sales, essentially announcing the death throes of the 78 rpm format. The last Presley single released on 78 in the United States was RCA Victor 20-7410, I Got Stung/One Night (1958), while the last 78 in the UK was RCA 1194, A Mess Of Blues/Girl Of My Best Friend (1960).

Given the below context:  It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...  Guess a valid title for it!

A mother, who wanted to create an extravagant cake for her daughter's fourth birthday, went all out - by baking a four foot tall Peppa Pig cake. Devoted Maria Young spent four days creating the 133,000-calorie treat to look like piglet George. She got builder husband Wayne to make a wooden frame and then covered it in sponge, icing and Rice Krispies. It's life size! Brooke Young's mother Maria, created the extravagant Peppa Pig themed cake for Brooke's fourth birthday. The end result was a cake taller than daughter Brooke, which at five and a half stone, weighed as much as a ten year-old and was enough to feed 700 people. But thrifty Maria, 30, says it cost her just £100 after she took advantage of as many multi-buy offers as she could find. She melted 17 bags of marshmallow into almost 12 boxes of Rice Krispies to create the legs and head, which alone weighed in excess of 15lbs. Quite a mouthful: Maria's hard work resulted in a cake weighing five and a half stone. Good effort! Maria, 30, spent four days creating the 133,000-calorie treat to look like piglet George. She then baked five 12-inch vanilla sponge cakes, using 4lbs of flour, 4lbs of sugar, 4lbs of butter and three dozen large eggs. She covered the big cake in almost 9lbs of buttercream, using 3lbs of butter and 6lbs of icing sugar. Finally the whole thing was coated in 28lbs of icing made from 22lbs of fondant, 4lbs of icing sugar and 4lbs of butter - and six full bottles of food dye. Brooke, her sister Emily, eight, and brother Logan, nine, helped put the cake together in the lounge of their home in Dorking, Surrey. Hungry? Maria's masterpiece was enough to feed 700 people. Calorific: Doctors recommend girls aged four need 1200 calories every day, meaning the huge cake contains enough calories to feed little Brooke for more than 110 days. Enough to go around: Maria cut 40 portions of cake at the party and she says it barely made a dent. It was unveiled on Tuesday night at daughter Brooke's fourth birthday party in front of dozens of stunned family and friends. Maria said: 'I'm so proud of this cake. It took absolutely ages, but that's what Brooke wanted. 'I asked her what she wanted for her birthday and said she wanted a super tall George cake. 'I'm surprised she didn't want Peppa, but I didn't want to argue - making trousers out of icing is much easier than making a dress.' She added: 'The party was brilliant, everyone was talking about the cake. We must have cut out about 40 portions of the cake, and it barely made a dent. Chuffed: Brooke Young blows out the candles on her amazing birthday cake, created by her mother in four days. Slow and steady: The gigantic cake took Maria four days to construct. Prepared to share: Maria says that any leftover cake will be taken to local food banks. 'All my children have taken about 30 more servings each to school for their classmates, and Wayne took about ten big slabs to work for his mates. 'But even after all that, we've still got well over half of it left. I'm going to speak to my local food bank and ask if I can donate some cake to them.' Maria, who has no formal baking training, is planning on setting up her own bakery, specialising in massive cakes. Earlier this year for Emily's birthday, Maria made a My Little Pony cake containing 250,000 calories. She said: 'George was much more difficult than the pony cake, because it involved a lot more sculpting and precision work. 'After the pony, I vowed to never go baking mad again, but when Brooke asked for a special cake like her sister's, I just couldn't say no.'

In contrast, the hypothesis states that a man is sleeping. Considering the provided information, the options given are: (1). Yes; (2). It is not possible to tell; (3). No; To analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to examine whether the information in the premise supports, contradicts, or has no impact on the hypothesis. First, let us break down the premise and the hypothesis into their essential components. In the premise, we have a man who is walking and his location, in front of a colorful wall mural. In the hypothesis, there is a man who is sleeping. There is a stark contrast between the actions described in the premise and the hypothesis: \\"walking\\" versus \\"sleeping.\\" Walking is an activity that requires the person to be awake, whereas sleeping implies the person is not awake. Now, let's look at the multi-select problem query: \\"Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?\\" Based on the comparison between the premise and the hypothesis, we can deduce that these two statements are contradictory. Since the man is walking in the premise, this indicates that he is awake, while the hypothesis suggests that the man is asleep. Therefore, we can conclude that it is not possible for the hypothesis to be true if the premise is true. Accordingly, the appropriate answer to this multi-select problem is option (3). No; as the hypothesis does not align with the premise and the two situations appear to be mutually exclusive, given the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Still, the economy has added an average of 151,000 jobs a month this year, roughly the same as last year's pace. That's not enough to satisfy the 12.8 million Americans who are unemployed.

Answer this question: of the seven wonders of the ancient world which is the only one you can still see today??","output":"The only remaining wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that you can still see today is the Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops. Located in Egypt, on the Giza Plateau near Cairo, the Great Pyramid is an awe-inspiring and enduring symbol of the ingenuity and architectural prowess of the ancient Egyptians. The list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World was compiled by ancient Greek historians and included the following structures: 1. Great Pyramid of Giza (Egypt) 2. Hanging Gardens of Babylon (Iraq) 3. Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (Turkey) 4. Statue of Zeus at Olympia (Greece) 5. Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (Turkey) 6. Colossus of Rhodes (Greece) 7. Lighthouse of Alexandria (Egypt) Unfortunately, all of the other six wonders have been destroyed due to various factors, including earthquakes, fires, and human conflict over the centuries. The Great Pyramid, however, has managed to withstand the test of time and continues to stand as a testament to ancient Egyptian civilization. Constructed during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu in the Fourth Dynasty around 2580-2560 BCE, the Great Pyramid was built as a royal tomb for the pharaoh and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. With an original height of approximately 146.5 meters (481 feet) and a base measuring 230 meters (755 feet) on each side, the Great Pyramid was an incredible feat of engineering that required precise planning, design, and execution. The massive structure was composed of more than 2.3 million limestone and granite blocks, some weighing as much as 80 tons, and it is believed that it took around 20 years to complete the pyramid. The construction techniques used to build the Great Pyramid remain the subject of significant debate among historians and archaeologists, but it is generally accepted that a combination of ramps, levers, counterweights, and a highly skilled labor force were utilized to build this monumental structure. While the outer casing stones of polished limestone that once adorned the pyramid have been mostly removed or eroded over time, the Great Pyramid's core structure remains intact, ensuring that the oldest and most iconic of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World can still be seen and appreciated by people today. In modern times, the Great Pyramid of Giza has continued to intrigue and captivate scholars, tourists, and researchers alike. This incredible ancient monument sparks curiosity and admiration not only for its impressive size and design but also for its intricate inner chambers, which include the King's Chamber, the Queen's Chamber, and the Great Gallery. Scientific research, archeological exploration, and remarkable technological advances such as the use of robots to explore inaccessible areas continue to reveal new and exciting secrets about the Great Pyramid and its construction. In conclusion, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today. Its durability, stunning architecture, and the many intriguing mysteries surrounding its construction, continue to captivate and inspire people from all around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? The first step is rest — stop all exacerbating activity in order to address your injury, at least for a few days or so. More rest (a few weeks) may be needed depending on the severity of your back injury. For a backache, laying on your back with your knees bent and legs slightly elevated is a good idea because it can take the pressure off the low back joints and provide some pain relief.  Laying on your back for hours at a time is not a good idea, either. Get up at least once an hour to move around even a little bit, and try going for a leisurely walk every day. Avoid excessive sitting (more than 30 minutes at a time) because it puts more pressure on the low back joints and may further irritate them. Cold therapy (ice wrapped in a thin towel or frozen gel packs) should be applied to the injury as soon as possible in order to stop reduce inflammation. Ice should be applied for 10 – 15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside. Compressing the ice against your back will help to further combat the inflammation.  Backaches from joint sprains are usually described as sharp and shooting in nature and they tend to be fairly debilitating. Most range of motion in the affected area is lost, and walking, sitting and sleeping are noticeably impaired. People with spinal joint sprains usually walk hunched over and to the side because the muscles surrounding the affected joints quickly spasm to \\"guard\\" the injury. Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists that focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement. You can often hear a \\"popping\\" sound with a spinal adjustment, similar in concept to when you extend your knuckles. Traction techniques or stretching of your spine may also help.  Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back sprain, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results. If uneven leg lengths or flat feet is deemed to be the primary cause of your backache, then your doctor or chiropractor may recommend orthotics, which are custom made shoe inserts that support the arches, promote better biomechanics when running or walking, and help alleviate back pain. A facet joint injection involves real-time fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance of a needle through the back muscles and into the inflamed or irritated spinal joint, followed by a release of an anesthetic and corticosteroid mixture, which quickly relieves both pain and inflammation at the site. Facet joint injections take 20 – 30 minutes to do and the results can last from a few weeks to a few months.  Facet joint injections are limited to three within a six-month time frame. The pain relief benefits from facet joint injections typically begin on the second or third day post treatment. Until that time frame, your backache may get a little worse.

Here is an article: Updated AUG 1, 2015 at 9:13a ET U.S. Olympic leaders have started contacting Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington about the possibility of bidding for the 2024 Games and believe the demise of Boston's candidacy will be \\"ancient history\\" by the time the host city is selected in 2017. In an interview Saturday with The Associated Press, U.S. Olympic Committee chairman Larry Probst said a decision will be made by the end of August on which of three cities should replace Boston as the American contender in a race that already features four European cities. \\"We've got to reconnect with the three cities that were part of the group of finalists,\\" Probst said on the sidelines of the IOC general assembly in Kuala Lumpur. \\"We've got to determine what their level of interest is in pursuing a bid and take that feedback and gather our board together and discuss that feedback with our board and make a decision.\\" \\"That will all happen in the month of August,\\" he added. \\"We will have resolved this by the end of the month.\\" Probst gave his most extensive public comments since the USOC cut ties with Boston on Monday, pulling the plug on a bid plagued by a lack of public support. The USOC now faces a Sept. 15 IOC deadline to enter a bid that would replace Boston, which had been chosen ahead of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington. Los Angeles, which hosted the 1932 and 1984 Olympics, is widely viewed as the likely choice. \\"We'll talk to them just like we'll talk to San Francisco and Washington,\\" Probst said. Probst said the USOC has begun the process of sounding out the three cities about stepping in, but declined to say what kind of response the committee has received so far. \\"We're going to share that feedback with our board first,\\" he said. The feedback from International Olympic members, meanwhile, has been loud and clear: \\"Surprisingly strong encouragement to bid,\\" Probst said. Many IOC members have told the AP they would welcome a Los Angeles bid. \\"They've heard the speculation, they've read the speculation and of course they assume it's going to happen,\\" Probst said. \\"They want to see a bid from the United States. We would love to host the games in 2024 and hope to have a strong bid.\\" Probst said numerous IOC members have spoken to him here about Boston's withdrawal. \\"Everybody thinks it's unfortunate,\\" he said. \\"When we chose Boston, we thought that it was going to be a strong bid. ... But at the end of the day we couldn't get the support of the local community. If you can't get the public to support a bid, you're not going to win. So we had to do what we thought was in the best interests of the USOC.\\" Probst poured cold water on the possibility of a joint bid between Los Angeles and San Francisco, though he didn't rule it out completely. \\"That would be complicated — not impossible, but complicated,\\" he said. Paris and Rome are among the declared candidates for 2024, along with Hamburg, Germany, and Budapest, Hungary. Toronto and Baku, Azerbaijan, are also weighing possible bids. The IOC will select the host city at its session Lima, Peru, in 2017. The U.S. hasn't hosted a Summer Games since Atlanta staged the 1996 Olympics. New York and Chicago failed in bids for the 2012 and 2016 Games, respectively. Asked whether the Boston debacle had damaged U.S. chances for 2024, Probst said: \\"I don't think so. I think that episode will be ancient history by the time that we get to Lima in 2017.\\" IOC President Thomas Bach this week accused Boston of failing to deliver on its \\"promises\\" to the USOC. Mayor Marty Walsh fired back that he wouldn't be \\"forced into spending taxpayers' money at risk.\\" \\"I have a lot of respect for Mayor Walsh,\\" Probst said. \\"I think he's a terrific guy. We had a good working relationship with him. We're going to take the high road and not get involved in any kind of finger pointing or accusatory remarks. I'm a big fan of Mayor Walsh. I'm clearly a big fan of Thomas Bach.\\" Bach raised eyebrows this week when he declared that the IOC had a \\"commitment\\" from the USOC to submit a 2024 bid. \\"I was a little surprised at the remark that he made,\\" Probst said, \\"but, yes, we would like to bid for 2024. We have said consistently that is our desire to have a bid for the Summer Games in 2024.

(Associated Press)      PARIS (AP) — An open letter signed by movie star Catherine Deneuve and dozens of other French women about men being unfairly targeted by sexual misconduct allegations has prompted a backlash in the French press and on social media.      In the letter, published in Le Monde newspaper, Deneuve and about 100 actresses, writers, scholars and artists argued that the \\"legitimate protest against sexual violence\\" stemming from the Harvey Weinstein scandal has gone too far and threatens hard-won sexual freedoms. They said men should be free to hit on women and advocated against \\"puritanism.\\"      On Wednesday, French women's rights activists denounced the letter as \\"a bit like the awkward work colleague or annoying uncle who doesn't understand what's happening.\\"      The activists, including feminist Caroline De Haas, wrote on the Franceinfotv website that Deneuve and other signatories are making sexual violence appear \\"normal.\\"      Marlene Schiappa, France's junior minister for women's rights, told France Culture radio: \\"There are in this open letter some things that are deeply offensive and false.\\"      The letter signed by Deneuve said some women may see being rubbed against by a man in the metro as an expression of \\"sexual deprivation\\" or a \\"non-event.\\"      Schiappa countered that \\"it's dangerous to say such things,\\" and insisted that such an act constituted sexual assault punishable with up to 3 years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros (90,100).      Writer Abnousse Shalmani, one of those who signed the open letter, said she was surprised by the \\"extremely violent reactions\\" it prompted.      \\"I consider myself to be a grown up. I am capable of receiving a sexual proposition and even more capable of saying no\\", she said on Europe 1 radio.      Italian filmmaker and actress Asia Argento, one of the dozens of women who have alleged Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them, called the letter \\"deplorable\\" in a tweet. ||||| Veteran French actress Catherine Deneuve was among 100 women who signed an open letter last week, slamming what they termed “expeditious justice” spurred by the #MeToo movement and defending a man’s “freedom to importune.” The letter published in Le Monde has been the source of much debate in the past several days. Denueve herself is now responding.      In her own open letter published by Libération Sunday night local time, the actress stands by signing the manifesto while also explaining her position and apologizing to “all victims of odious acts who may have felt offended” by the letter whose text she says does not claim that harassment is a good thing.      Saying she felt a need to clarify her position, Deneuve writes, “Yes, I like freedom. I don’t like this characteristic of our times whereby everyone feels they have the right to judge, to arbitrate, to condemn. A time where simple denunciations on social media generate punishment, resignation and sometimes, and often, lynching by the media… I don’t excuse anything. I don’t decide the guilt of these men because I am not qualified to do so. And few are… No, I don’t like this pack mentality.”      Saying she found the manifesto “vigorous” if not “perfectly right,” she declares, “Yes, I signed this petition, and yet it seems to me absolutely necessary today to underline my disagreement with the manner in which some of the signatories claim the right to permeate the media, distorting the spirit of the original text.” She goes on to cite, without naming her, a woman who appeared on television saying it is possible to have an orgasm during a rape. Such a declaration “is worse than spitting in the face of all those who have suffered this crime,” Deneuve writes.      She adds, “Obviously nothing in the text claims that harassment is good, otherwise I would not have signed it.”      The Oscar-nominated star of Indochine points out she has been an actress since age 17 and could say she has “witnessed situations that were more than indelicate, or that I know through other actors that filmmakers have abused their power in a cowardly manner.” But, “it is not for me to speak in the place of my sisters.”      An essential reason Deneuve says she signed the text is “the danger of the purging of the arts. Are we going to burn Sade from La Pléiade? Designate Leonardo da Vinci as a pedophile artist and erase his paintings? Take Gaugin off museum walls? Destroy the drawings of Egon Schiele? Ban Phil Spector’s records? This climate of censorship leaves me speechless and worried about the future of our societies.”      Deneuve concludes, “I have sometimes been reproached for not being a feminist,” and reminds that she was one of 343 women who signed the 1971 manifesto defending abortion rights that was written by Simone de Beauvoir. “Abortion was punishable by criminal prosecution and imprisonment at the time. That is why I want to say to conservatives, racists and traditionalists of all kinds who have found it strategic to support me, I am not fooled. They will have neither my gratitude nor my friendship, quite the contrary. I am a free woman and I will continue to be. I warmly salute all the victims of odious acts who may have felt offended by the letter published in Le Monde, it’s to them and them alone that I apologize.” ||||| French actor says she stands by letter that caused outcry but condemns other signatories for distorting the spirit of its message      Catherine Deneuve has apologised to female victims of sexual assault who were shocked and hurt by the controversial letter she signed attacking the #MeToo campaign.      The French actor said she stood by the statement that caused an international outcry when it was published last week, but distanced herself from a number of other female signatories.      Le Monde newspaper, which ran the original letter, described Deneuve’s response to the row as “a form of mea culpa”.      About 100 French women, including high-profile writers, artists and academics, put their names to the attack on a wave of Anglo-American “puritanism” following the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal. They suggested the #MeToo campaign (#BalanceTonPorc – Squeal on Your Pig – in France) in which women denounced their alleged attackers had gone too far. They defended the right of men to “importune” in the name of “sexual freedom” and claimed men were being subjected to a witch-hunt.      In her letter, published in Libération, Deneuve said she had signed the statement because she opposed the “media lynching” of men accused of inappropriate behaviour and found its message “vigorous” if not “entirely right”.      “Yes, I signed that petition, however, it seems absolutely necessary today to underline my disagreement with the way certain signatories have individually assumed the right to expand upon it in the media, distorting the spirit of the text,” she wrote.      She referred to former radio presenter Brigitte Lahaie, who during a heated debate on BFMTV said women were able to “orgasm during a rape”. Without mentioning Lahaie by name, Deneuve said this was “worse than spitting in the face of those who have suffered this crime”.      “Not only do these words suggest to those who are used to using force or sexuality to destroy that it’s not so serious … but when one signs a manifesto that engages other people, one avoids dragging them into one’s own verbal incontinence. It’s unworthy. And obviously nothing in the text claims that harassment is good, otherwise I wouldn’t have signed it,” she wrote.      Reminding those who questioned her feminist credentials that she was among 343 women, including feminist writer Simone de Beauvoir, to sign a 1971 declaration admitting they had an abortion when it was still illegal, Deneueve dismissed the “conservatives, racists and traditionalists of all kinds who have found it strategic to give me their support”.      “I am not fooled,” she wrote. “They will not have my gratitude or my friendship. Quite the opposite.      “I’m a free woman and I will remain one. I fraternally salute all women victims of odious acts who might have felt assaulted by the letter in Le Monde. It is to them, and them alone, that I apologise.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"French actress Catherine Deneuve has apologised to victims of sexual assault who may have felt offended by an open letter criticising the \\"#MeToo\\" movement.

Article: Story highlights Martha Burk: Augusta National Golf Club, site of the Masters, doesn't admit women      But this year the CEO of IBM, a major sponsor whose CEOs are given membership, is a woman      She says this puts IBM in a bind: Should it ditch sponsorship if CEO not admitted? She says yes      Burk: It's IBM's directors' responsibility to insist their CEO be treated like \\"one of the boys\\"      Well, well. The boys at Augusta National Golf Club -- members and sponsors alike -- are in a big bind. Nine years after I led an unsuccessful effort by the National Council of Women's Organizations to open membership in the club to women, the \\"woman problem\\" is back.      This time it involves Virginia Rometty, the first female chief executive of IBM. IBM is a major sponsor of Augusta National's Masters Golf Tournament, and up to now its CEOs have always been given membership in the club. But none has ever been a woman. So what happens now -- will Augusta National open its doors to women? Or will IBM pull its sponsorship and force its other executives to resign their club memberships?      These are the only two real choices.      Martha Burk      We've said all along that this is not about golf. It is about access to the places where big business is done, deals are made and careers are boosted or broken. Half of Augusta's membership (which reads like a roster of Fortune 500 CEOs) probably doesn't even care about golf, but the members do care about power relationships. According to Fortune magazine , \\"golf remains the true communications hub of America's business elite.\\"      Back in 2003 when opposition to the all-male policy was making headlines, I got two calls from sponsors who said they were \\"in dialogue\\" with the club. The first was from Coca-Cola, saying its board was going to make a decision after talking to \\"Warren (Buffett) and Sam (Nunn),\\" board members who were also Augusta members. I was promised a call in the next two or three days. I'm still waiting.      My second call was much more hostile. It was from IBM, telling me my organization was \\"forcing\\" them to do something they didn't want to do, and generally dressing me down for making an issue of the bald-faced sexism that their sponsorship supported.      JUST WATCHED Erin Burnett's essay on Ginnie Rometty Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Erin Burnett's essay on Ginnie Rometty 01:54      A few days later Hootie Johnson, then chairman of Augusta National, stepped to a microphone and announced the club was releasing its sponsors, broadcasting the tournament without commercials. The boys had clearly made a deal that went like this: We'll \\"release\\" you as sponsors, you'll keep your mouths shut, and when all this woman stuff blows over you can quietly come back. Two of the three did not return (IBM was the exception), but none of the sponsors ever condemned the male-only policy at Augusta National.      IBM is surely scrambling for what it hopes will be another face-saving deal. The CBSSports.com senior golf columnist Steve Elling predicts that club Chairman Billy Payne will offer Rometty a membership a few days after the Masters ends next week: \\"She shows up at the tournament in 2013 in green, after the gender issue has died down. That way, the club avoids the appearance that Payne has been backed into a corner or forced into making an accommodation.\\"      Sorry, but that dog won't hunt. Telling Rometty to be a good girl and wait a little longer with IBM's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company's image, but for Rometty's credibility as its leader. Elling's scenario would scream that IBM values the relationship with a club that proudly discriminates more than it values its own integrity -- or its first female CEO.      What if, on the other hand, Rometty makes an announcement that she's not interested in membership? That won't work either. It would be widely assumed that she was under pressure from the company to make such a statement, and in the bargain accept her second-class status. After all, CEOs (male and female) don't get where they are by making waves. But fixing this shouldn't be put on her. It's the responsibility of the board of directors to insist that their CEO be treated exactly like -- well -- one of the boys.      Besides, whether she would accept a membership is completely irrelevant to the question of the appropriateness of the club's all-male policy and IBM's tacit support of it, and it doesn't get the club out of its bind anyway. Before she can reject a membership, she has to be offered one. If Augusta National admits it was prepared to make an offer but she wouldn't accept, it has admitted that membership is open to women, and it will immediately be asked who the next candidate will be and when. If the club remains silent, IBM's problem reverberates louder.      And saying the gender issue will die down is wishful thinking. The women's movement opened the doors to the executive suites for women like Rometty with 30 years of hard work that made sex discrimination in hiring and promotion in corporate America illegal. If we hadn't raised the ruckus in 2003, you can bet it wouldn't be front and center now. And though we haven't succeeded yet, we won't stop until females are treated equally in corporate-supported venues like Augusta National Golf Club, or until those companies are shamed into pulling support.      If this were about race discrimination and a black (male) CEO, IBM surely wouldn't be in the mix, and no other national sponsor would go near this club. But it's only the girls -- and sex discrimination is just not as serious. Or is it?      We're listening for IBM's answer. ||||| (CNN) -- President Obama on Thursday made clear his view on the membership of women at the Augusta National Golf Club: They should be admitted.      The issue of the membership of the club that hosts most prestigious golf tournament is being scrutinized because the top executive at IBM, Ginni Rometty, is a woman.      IBM's sponsorship of the Masters tournament guarantees club membership for its officers, but the club does not allow women to join.      The White House weighed in Thursday.      \\"The president's answer is yes, he believes women should be admitted,\\" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters at a briefing.      Specifically, Obama believes it is \\"up to the club to decide, (but) his personal opinion is that women should be admitted to the club.\\"      The Republican presidential candidates also weighed in. Mitt Romney agreed that it is up to the club to decide on female members when asked about the issue at a campaign event Thursday.      \\"Of course,\\" he said. \\"I am not a member of Augusta. I don't know if I would qualify. My golf game is not that good. Certainly if I were a member, if I could run Augusta, which isn't likely to happen, of course I'd have women into Augusta.\\"      Rick Santorum, in a statement e-mailed to reporters, said, \\"I encourage Augusta to accept women members, but I recognize their right as a private organization to decide for themselves.\\"      Newt Gingrich said his wife, Callista, a golfer herself, would be a \\"great member.\\"      During his annual media session Wednesday, Billy Payne, chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club, did not comment specifically on Rometty.      \\"Well, as has been the case, whenever that question is asked, all issues of membership are now and have historically been subject to the private deliberation of members,\\" he said. \\"That statement remains accurate; it remains my statement.\\"      IBM spokesman Ed Barbini told CNN on Wednesday that the company would not comment on the controversy.      Most Augusta patrons seem untroubled by the policy      The question of Rometty's membership has again brought the gender controversy to the forefront.      Women's rights activist Martha Burk tried to change the exclusionary policy nine years ago when she showed up at the Augusta entrance to lead a series of protests against men-only membership.      Her efforts were in vain.      Now, she says, \\"the boys\\" at Augusta, members and sponsors alike, find themselves in a big bind.      \\"The 'woman problem' is back,\\" she wrote in a column for CNN on Tuesday.      Burk says there are only two choices at hand: Augusta can open its doors to women, or IBM can yank its money and force its male executives to resign from the club.      \\"Those are the only two options that are viable that are going to wash with the public,\\" Burk told CNN last week.      Augusta's membership -- which includes titans of industry and finance -- has been male-only since the club's opening in 1932.      When Burk tried to change things in 2002, Augusta's then-chairman, Hootie Johnson, resisted, saying that gender integration would not come \\"at the point of a bayonet.\\"      In 2006, Burk was among a group of Exxon shareholders who accused the company of violating its discrimination policies by supporting the tournament.      Nonmembers can play on the course only when hosted by members.      Augusta is famously secretive about its membership, and the club declined to comment on the issue, as did IBM spokesman Chris Andrews.      \\"Augusta is a private club, and their personal membership is an internal matter,\\" he said.      IBM, however, has played a role in changing policy before. The company pulled television ads from the PGA Championship when it was played at the whites-only Shoal Creek golf club in Alabama. The club admitted its first African-American in 1990 and now claims former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a member.      Augusta also did not welcome its first black member until 1990, when Gannett television division president Ron Townsend joined the club.      On the eve of the 2012 Masters opening Thursday, speculation surfaced that Payne, known to be more progressive than his predecessor, would offer Rometty a membership, but only after the tournament ends and the gender debate dies down.      \\"Sorry, but that dog won't hunt,\\" Burk wrote. \\"Telling Rometty to be a good girl and wait a little longer with IBM's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company's image, but for Rometty's credibility as its leader.\\"      More and more people are asking Augusta to man up and get rid of what they say is a discriminatory policy from the past.      Payne did not announce any sweeping changes from the hot seat Wednesday. That means that Rometty will probably not show up this year in a green jacket.      The question is: Will she ever? |||||Summary:","output":"The Augusta National Golf Club, a special place where people play golf, doesn't allow women to become members.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the people that influenced Fritz Theodor Albert Delius in Sweden? from the following article ?  Delius was born in Bradford in Yorkshire. He was baptised as \\"Fritz Theodor Albert Delius\\", and used the forename Fritz until he was about 40. He was the second of four sons (there were also ten daughters) born to Julius Delius (1822–1901) and his wife Elise Pauline, née Krönig (1838–1929). Delius's parents were born in Bielefeld, Westphalia, of Dutch origin; the family had for some generations been settled in German lands near the Rhine. Julius's father, Ernst Friedrich Delius, had served under Blücher in the Napoleonic Wars. Julius moved to England to further his career as a wool merchant, and became a naturalised British subject in 1850. He married Elise in 1856.The Delius household was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, and played for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz was drawn to the music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth (just west of London) between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to the city for Delius to be able to attend concerts and opera.Julius Delius assumed that his son would play a part in the family wool business, and for the next three years he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's representative in Stroud in Gloucestershire,... Answer:","output":"The article provided does not specifically mention the full names of the people that influenced Fritz Theodor Albert Delius in Sweden. It does, however, mention several musicians and individuals who had an impact on Delius's life and musical development, such as Joseph Joachim, Carlo Alfredo Piatti, Rudolph Bauerkeller, George Haddock, Chopin, Grieg, and John Coates. These influential figures helped shape Delius's musical preferences and contributed to his education and growth as a musician. Among these, Chopin and Grieg were particularly important, as the article states that Delius favored their music over the Austro-Germanic compositions of Mozart and Beethoven. It is essential to note that Delius studied and worked in various places, including England (Bradford, Isleworth, and Stroud), Germany, and eventually France, where he settled and gained recognition as a composer. The article does not mention Delius spending a significant amount of time in Sweden or being influenced by specific Swedish individuals. Further research may be required to determine the exact individuals who impacted Delius during his time in Sweden or if there were any Swedish influences on his music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Rise of Phone Reading Last fall, Andrew Vestal found himself rocking his baby daughter, Ada, back to sleep every morning between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. Cradling Ada in the crook of his arm, he discovered he could read his dimly-lit phone with one hand. That’s how he read David Mitchell’s 624-page science-fiction saga “The Bone Clocks.” Mr. Vestal’s iPhone has offered him a way to squeeze in time for reading that he otherwise might have given up. He reads on lunch breaks. He even reads between meetings as he walks across Microsoft’s Seattle campus, where he works as a program manager. Before he tried it, he wondered whether reading in snippets might be dissatisfying. But to his surprise, he found he could quickly re-immerse himself in the book he was reading. “I want reading to be part of my life,” said Mr. Vestal, age 35. “If I waited for the kind of time I used to have—sitting down for five hours—I wouldn’t read at all.” Ever since the first hand-held e-readers were introduced in the 1990s, the digital-reading revolution has turned the publishing world upside down. But contrary to early predictions, it’s not the e-reader that will be driving future book sales, but the phone. “The future of digital reading is on the phone,” said Judith Curr, publisher of the Simon & Schuster imprint Atria Books. “It’s going to be on the phone and it’s going to be on paper.” For now, tablets like the iPad and Kindle Fire remain the most popular platform to read digital books. According to Nielsen, the percentage of e-book buyers who read primarily on tablets was 41% in the first quarter of 2015, compared with 30% in 2012. But what has captured publishers’ attention is the increase in the number of people reading their phones. In a Nielsen survey of 2,000 people this past December, about 54% of e-book buyers said they used smartphones to read their books at least some of the time. That’s up from 24% in 2012, according to a separate study commissioned by Nielsen. The number of people who read primarily on phones has risen to 14% in the first quarter of 2015 from 9% in 2012. Meanwhile, those reading mainly on e-readers, such as Kindles and Nooks, dropped over the same period to 32% from 50%. Even tablet reading has declined recently to 41% in the first quarter this year from 44% in 2014. The rise of phone reading is pushing publishers to rethink the way books are designed, marketed and sold with smaller screens in mind. It’s also prompting concern about whether deep, concentrated thinking is possible amid the ringing, buzzing and alerts that come with phones. One reason people are reading on phones is convenience. If you’re standing in line at the deli, waiting at the DMV or riding home on the train, you may not have a print book or an e-reader or tablet. But chances are, you are carrying a smartphone. Some 64% of American adults now own a smartphone, up from 35% in the spring of 2011, according to the Pew Research Center. Forrester Research, a research and advisory firm, projects that smartphone subscribers will number 80.8% of the U.S. population by 2019. “The best device to read on is the one you have with you,” said Willem Van Lancker, co-founder and chief product officer of the subscription-book service Oyster. “It requires no planning. My bookshelf at home isn’t any good to me when I’m at the park.” Another reason people are turning to phones is the size and clarity of new smartphone models, which make reading much easier. The average smartphone screen in 2014 was 5.1 inches—compared with a 3.9-inch average in 2011, according to eMarketer. Since the release of the bigger, sharper iPhone 6 and 6 Plus last September, Apple has seen an increase in the number of people downloading books onto iPhones through its iBooks app. Some 45% of iBooks purchases are now downloaded onto iPhones, an Apple spokeswoman said. Before that, only 28% were downloaded onto phones, with most of the remainder downloaded onto iPads and a small percentage onto computers. Amazon has also noted the development. Among all new customers using Kindles or the Kindle app, phone readers are by far the fastest-growing segment, an Amazon spokeswoman said, declining to disclose figures. Among those who use the Kindle app, more people now read books on the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus than on any other Apple device, even the popular iPad Mini, she said. To engage readers, publishers are now experimenting with ways to make the mobile-reading experience better. They are designing book jackets with smartphone screens in mind. (Handwritten scripts or small fonts may not be legible.) They are customizing their marketing materials—email blasts, Facebook posts and websites—to be read on phones. And some are trying to catch people on the go, offering free access to e-books in airports, hotels and trains. “How do I serve something up to somebody who perhaps wasn’t thinking about a book two minutes ago?” said Liz Perl, the chief marketing officer at Simon & Schuster, which has teamed up with Foli, a mobile-distribution platform, to offer free e-books at specific GPS coordinates. “The read-anywhere option is amazing. It’s an obligation for us as publishers to find those people.” Through the Foli mobile app, Simon & Schuster in May offered David McCullough’s “The Wright Brothers” free at more than 50 U.S. airports. In June, it served up “Yoga for Life” by Colleen Saidman Yee at the Solstice in Times Square yoga festival in New York. Now the publisher offers free e-books at hotels and airport lounges in New York, California, Missouri, Florida, Texas and Hawaii. Users can read as much of each book as they like free, as long as they stay within the prescribed geographical area. Earlier this year, Penguin Random House introduced free excerpts of e-books on Amtrak’s Acela Express trains, including, naturally, Paula Hawkins’s “The Girl on the Train.” Most people who read on their phones toggle back and forth between devices, using whichever is closest at hand when opportunity strikes, according to a survey this year by the book-recommendation site Goodreads. Nearly two-thirds of respondents who read on their phones said they did so because they didn’t have their e-reader or tablet with them. Amazon, Google, Apple and Barnes & Noble all offer smartphone apps for reading books. They automatically sync all devices linked to the same account, so a reader can open an e-book on her phone and pick up exactly where she left off the night before on her e-reader or tablet. Amazon and Google recently introduced custom e-book fonts, both designed to be more legible on smartphone screens. Fully 55% of all Oyster’s activity is now happening on phones, and the company in June introduced a new display option called Lumin that reduces the amount of blue light emitted from smartphone and tablet screens to make reading easier on the eyes at night (its users’ peak reading time). “I think people are reading constantly now, and it’s because of phones,” Mr. Van Lancker said. Publishers are also devoting significant resources to developing apps that complement e-books and offer additional content from authors—from smoothie recipes and diet guidelines to “Curious George” games and daily affirmations inspired by the best-selling middle-grade novel “Wonder.” All are intended to keep mobile users engaged, and coming back for more books. The literary world is divided over whether a phone can deliver the experience of deep, concentrated reading. Scholars who study the subject note that smartphones are an important part of the effort to improve literacy in developing countries where books and computers are out of reach for many people. Reading on a phone is better than not reading at all, these experts all agree. But there is debate about whether the phone is appropriate for long-form reading, if other options are available. With all their ringing, dinging and buzzing, smartphones are designed to alert and distract users, notes Naomi S. Baron, a professor of linguistics at American University and author of “Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in a Digital World.” Even when a phone’s alerts are turned off, your brain is still primed for disruption when you pick it up, she said. That could make a phone worse for reading than an e-reader. “The phone is antithetical to deep reading,” said Maryanne Wolf, a neuroscientist at Tufts University who studies the reading brain. For most people, she said, a phone will make concentrated reading more difficult— though not impossible. Anna Todd, writer of the “After” series on the serial publishing platform Wattpad, argues that phones are encouraging people to read more. Wattpad has 40 million monthly users—almost 90% of whom are on mobile devices. “People should stop worrying about how other people are reading, and be glad that they are,” said Ms. Todd, whose series generated 1.3 billion chapter views and a book deal with Simon & Schuster. Many readers report being able to concentrate just fine on their phones. (Some turn off their alerts). On Twitter, people have celebrated major feats of reading, accomplished entirely on smartphones, including “Moby-Dick,” “War and Peace,” and “Swann’s Way.” No one expects phones to replace print books altogether. And even avid phone readers acknowledge the devices have drawbacks. Many report feeling caught off guard when they reach the end of a book. They miss the physical sense of how deep they are into a book—and the feelings of accomplishment and anticipation that come with that. Others note that it is not as easy to share an e-book with friends as a hardcover or paperback. Many still read in print part of the time. Laura Jefferson, 59, of Concord, N.H., reads on her iPhone for convenience —on the bus to Boston, in the doctor’s waiting room and eating lunch by herself at her favorite cafe in Concord. But when she knows she wants to lend a book to family or friends, she buys it in print. Lloyd Miller, a musician from Brooklyn who reads on his phone and in print, used his iPhone to dip into Donna Tartt’s tome “The Goldfinch,” and found himself trying to read under his jacket in a Brooklyn movie theater, where he had taken his children to see Disney’s “Frozen.” Mr. Miller, 41, said he prefers print, but downloads books on his phone for reading on the subway. He used his phone to read Hilary Mantel’s “Bring Up the Bodies,” and parts of Robert Caro’s fourth installment on Lyndon Johnson —which was too heavy to lug around. He also has his phone stocked with Beverly Cleary’s Ramona books and Judy Blume’s “Superfudge” series. Traveling around the city with his son and daughter, ages 7 and 10, the children often clamor for his phone. He hands it to them, saying, “No games, but you can read a book.” Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The rise of smartphone usage for reading is causing publishers to rethink the way books are designed, marketed and sold, with smaller screens in mind.

It is especially used to refer to river islands found on the River Thames and its tributaries in England.  - Clewer (also known as Clewer Village) is an ecclesiastical parish and an area of Windsor in the county of Berkshire, England. Clewer makes up three wards of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, namely Clewer North, Clewer South and Clewer East.  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.

I read this background article the other day: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring towns used different approaches to agriculture. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which town had less growth of water plants because of fertilizer? Answer:","output":"Small town had less growth of water plants because of fertilizer. To provide a comprehensive understanding in relation to the background article and the situation at hand, it is essential to delve into the different approaches to agriculture undertaken by the two towns, as well as the environmental impact and potential consequences of each method. Big town opted for conventional agricultural practices, which involve the heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals help to boost crop yields and protect crops from pests, but they can also have significant negative impacts on the environment. When rainwater falls on these farmlands, it can pick up these chemicals and cause them to enter nearby rivers and lakes as runoff. The dissolved fertilizer, which often contains high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, can promote excessive growth of water plants and algae (eutrophication). This overgrowth can then lead to oxygen depletion in the water bodies, creating dead zones where aquatic life is unable to survive. Moreover, chemicals infiltrating into groundwater can eventually pollute wells, putting people who rely on this water source at risk of health issues. In contrast, Small town implemented permaculture principles and organic farming methods, which promote sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. Permaculture involves the design of agricultural ecosystems that are intended to be self-sustaining, resilient, and in harmony with the natural environment. Organic farming, on the other hand, eschews the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in favor of natural alternatives, such as compost, manure, and biological pest control. By avoiding or limiting the use of chemical fertilizers, Small town reduces the likelihood of harmful nutrient runoff entering local water bodies. Consequently, the risks of excessive plant growth, dead zones, and water well contamination are considerably lower. Given these contrasting approaches, it is evident that Small town, due to its practices of permaculture and organic farming, experienced less growth of water plants as a result of fertilizer usage. By choosing an agricultural system that prioritizes sustainability and environmental health, Small town has managed to mitigate many of the negative consequences associated with conventional chemical-intensive farming practices, leading to healthier water bodies and a reduced risk of groundwater pollution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Cyclopædia , or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences ( first ed. ) . James and John Knapton , et al .  - Livery of seisin is an archaic legal conveyancing ceremony, formerly practiced in feudal England and in other countries following English common law, used to convey holdings in property. The term \\"livery\\" is related to, if not synonymous with, the word \\"delivery\\" as used in modern contract law. The common law in those jurisdictions once provided that a valid conveyance of a feudal tenure in land required the physical transfer by the transferor to the transferee, in the presence of witnesses, of a piece of the ground itself, in the literal sense of a hand-to-hand passing of an amount of soil, a twig, key, or other symbol.  - In the abstract, property is that which belongs to or with something, whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing. In the context of this article, property is one or more components (rather than attributes), whether physical or incorporeal, of a person's estate; or so belonging to, as in being owned by, a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society. (Given such meaning, the word property is uncountable, and as such, is not described with an indefinite article or as plural.) Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a durable, mean or factor, or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it.  - The verb license or grant license means to give permission. The noun licence (British, Indian, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Irish, or South African English) or license (American English) refers to that permission as well as to the document recording that permission.  - In the law of evidence, a presumption of a particular fact can be made without the aid of proof in some situations. The types of presumption include a rebuttable discretionary presumption, a rebuttable mandatory presumption, and an irrebuttable or conclusive presumption. The invocation of a presumption shifts the burden of proof from one party to the opposing party in a court trial. Presumptions are sometimes categorized into two types: presumptions without basic facts, and presumptions with basic facts. In the United States, mandatory presumptions are impermissible in criminal cases, but permissible presumptions are allowed.  - A deed (anciently \\"an evidence\\") is any legal instrument in writing which passes, affirms or confirms an interest, right, or property and that is signed, attested, delivered, and in some jurisdictions, sealed. It is commonly associated with transferring title to property. The deed has a greater presumption of validity and is less rebuttable than an instrument signed by the party to the deed. A deed can be unilateral or bilateral. Deeds include conveyances, commissions, licenses, patents, diplomas, and conditionally powers of attorney if executed as deeds. The deed is the modern descendant of the medieval charter, and delivery is thought to symbolically replace the ancient ceremony of livery of seisin.  - A charter is the grant of authority or rights, stating that the granter formally recognizes the prerogative of the recipient to exercise the rights specified. It is implicit that the granter retains superiority (or sovereignty), and that the recipient admits a limited (or inferior) status within the relationship, and it is within that sense that charters were historically granted, and that sense is retained in modern usage of the term.  - Legal instrument is a legal term of art that is used for any formally executed written document that can be formally attributed to its author, records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or contractual duty, obligation, or right, and therefore evidences that act, process, or agreement. Examples include a certificate, deed, bond, contract, will, legislative act, notarial act, court writ or process, or any law passed by a competent legislative body in municipal (domestic) or international law. Many legal instruments were written \\"under seal\\" by affixing a wax or paper seal to the document in evidence of its legal execution and authenticity (which often removes the need for consideration in contract law); however, today many jurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal in order to give them legal effect.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who made Fritz feel neglected? , can you please find it?   In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years.  He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs.  In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld.  Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages.  Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published.  Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser.  While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.  Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.  For Speer's fiftieth birthday in March 1955, Wolters gathered letters from many of Speer's friends and wartime associates, and saw to it that they made their way inside the walls of Spandau in time for...

Article: More than one million children in the United States do not go to school. Instead, they learn at home. Most often, their parents are their teachers. Educational companies, libraries and the Internet provide many families with teaching materials. Parents choose home schooling for several reasons. Some choose it because of their religious beliefs. Others say it provides more time for the family to be together. They say the home offers a better place for learning. Some parents believe home schooling avoids learning. Some parents believe home schooling avoids problems of _ schools. Critics, however, say children need to attend school with other children. All fifty American states and the District of Columbia permit home schooling. Some states do not require much preparation by parents or testing of children. Other states have more requirements for home schooling. Home schooling in the United States began when the country was established. In farm areas, people often lived far from a school. Widespread home schooling took place until about the middle of the nineteenth century. Then, in 1852, the state of Massachusetts passed the first law requiring children to attend school. Over the years, the American public education system strengthened and grew. By the 1960s and 1970s, however, some Americans believed that traditional education was not helping their children. So a number of parents began home schooling. Home schooling expert Linda Dobson says many people have helped the movement grow. She says many kinds of people have joined the movement. These include rich people and poor people. They represent many races, religions and political beliefs. Ms. Dobson says the number of home-schooled children has increased an estimated fifteen to twenty percent each year during the last fifteen years.

While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch Andre as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. Andre picked him up out of the crowd and put him back behind the barricade. Context: Henry returned on the March 12, 2015 episode of SmackDown, confronting Roman Reigns for having a lack of identity and for not being respected, resulting in Reigns attacking Henry. The attack caused Henry to become a \\"believer\\" in Reigns and turning face again in the process. Henry was unsuccessful in the Elimination Chamber match for the vacant Intercontinental Championship at Elimination Chamber, replacing Rusev who was injured, but was eliminated by Sheamus On the June 1 episode of Raw, Henry unsuccessfully faced Reigns for his Money in the Bank spot. After the match, Henry attacked Reigns. Henry spent the remainder of 2015 suffering back to back losses in singles matches, losing to the likes of Big Show, Sheamus and Neville while constantly switching between face and heel.  On the 2016 Royal Rumble pre-show, Henry teamed with Jack Swagger to win a Fatal 4-Way tag team match to earn their spots in the Royal Rumble match. Despite this victory, Henry entered the Rumble match at #22 and lasted only 47 seconds when he was quickly eliminated by The Wyatt Family. On the February 8 episode of Raw, Henry walked out on The New Day during an 8-Man Tag team tables match against The Usos and The Dudley Boyz. On the February 15 episode of Raw, Henry lost to Big E; during the match Henry (kayfabe) suffered broken ribs leading to a botched (unplanned) ending. At WrestleMania 32, Henry entered his third Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, where made it to the final six competitors until being eliminated by Kane and Darren Young.  On July 19, at the 2016 WWE draft, Henry was drafted to Raw. On the August 1 episode of Raw, Henry claimed he still \\"had a lot left in him\\" when he spoke of reviving the Hall of Pain and his participation in the olympics. Raw General Manager Mick Foley gave Henry a United States Championship match, but Henry would lose by submission to Rusev. In October, Henry allied himself with R-Truth and Goldust in a feud against Titus O'Neil and The Shining Stars (Primo and Epico), in which Henry's team came out victorious. Henry returned at the 2017 Royal Rumble as entrant number 6, only to be eliminated by Braun Strowman. His final match was the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania 33.

To find out what 'q' is, we need to subtract the 1336 candies from the 1456 candies: 1456 - 1336 = 120 So, we're left with 24 groups of 'q' candies equaling 120 candies. Now we want to find out how many candies are in each group of 'q' candies. So we need to divide 120 candies by 24 groups: 120 / 24 = 5 candies So, 'q' equals 5 candies!

The desks and chairs make students have the correct posture, especially when reading and writing. Each desk has an adjustable steel bar. The bar can help students keep their eyes at least 30cm from books. Zhang Jianming is headmaster of the primary school. She said the new desks and chairs were provided by an eye care centre in the city. The school carried out a survey last September. It showed that about 7 percent of its 1,093 students said they suffered from short sight. The new desks and chairs have already improved the students' posture, but both teachers and students might need more time to get used to them. Yang Lihua is head of the Wuhan Youth Eye Care Center. She said the desks and chairs were introduced to 19 schools on a trial basis. \\"During our research into short sight, we noticed that the number of students with short sight was increasing. This is because parents are teaching their children to read and write at a very early age without paying enough attention to their posture,\\" she said. Feng Junying is a doctor at Beijing Jingshan School. \\"I think the new desks and chairs in Wuhan will certainly be helpful,\\" she said. \\"But bad reading habits at school are not the only reason for short sight. Children are using mobile phones and iPads when they are very young. This can be another reason for short sight at a young age.\\" Question: From the passage, a good way to protect our eyesight is to  _  .

I decided to catch a movie down at Tempe Marketplace the other day with a friend (Horrible Bosses, AWESOME) and decided to head upstairs to Cadillac for some pre- movie happy hour. Being that I sit at bars except for family dinners we ponied up. I saw that they had a couple of 4 Peaks beers on draft so I chose to go the peach ale route while my buddy grabbed a frozen margarita. Both were super refreshing, enough so that I eventually had 2 more! Got down on the preztels appetizer, which when dipped in the fondue tasted like little angels dancing on my tongue before I ate them! My buddy ordered the bacon wontons, which I had to steal one, and they were one of the best things with bacon I have ever tried (right up there with Citizen's bacon popcorn and Beckett's Tables' bacon smores!)

Answer the following question: Information:  - MBDA is a European developer and manufacturer of missiles. It was formed by a merger of French Aérospatiale-Matra Missiles (of EADS, now Airbus Group), Italian Alenia Marconi Systems (now Leonardo) and British Matra BAe Dynamics (of BAE Systems) in December 2001. In 2015 the company had 10,000 employees. In 2015, MBDA recorded orders for €5.2bn and an order book of €15.1 bn. MBDA works with over 90 armed forces worldwide.  - Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed. Radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II. The term \\"RADAR\\" was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. The term \\"radar\\" has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization.  - British Aerospace Dynamics Limited (BADL or BAe Dynamics) was a division of British Aerospace.  - Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) was a major European integrated defence electronics company and an equal shares joint venture between BAE Systems and Finmeccanica until its dissolution on May 3, 2005.  - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.  - Active radar homing (ARH) is a missile guidance method in which a missile contains a radar transceiver (in contrast to semi-active radar homing, which uses only a receiver) and the electronics necessary for it to find and track its target autonomously. NATO brevity code for an air-to-air active radar homing missile launch is Fox Three.  - Brimstone is an air - launched ground attack missile developed by MBDA for Britain 's Royal Air Force . It was originally intended for \`\` fire - and - forget '' use against mass formations of enemy armour , using a millimetric wave ( mmW ) active radar homing seeker to ensure accuracy even against moving targets . Experience in Afghanistan led to the addition of laser guidance in the dual - mode Brimstone missile , allowing a \`\` spotter '' to pick out specific targets when friendly forces or civilians were in the area . The tandem shaped charge warhead is much more effective against modern tanks than older similar weapons such as the AGM - 65G Maverick , while the small blast area minimises collateral damage . Three Brimstones are carried on a launcher that occupies a single weapon station , allowing a single aircraft to carry many missiles . After a protracted development programme , single - mode or \`\` millimetric '' Brimstone entered service with RAF Tornado aircraft in 2005 , and the dual - mode variant in 2008 . The latter has been extensively used in Afghanistan and Libya . An improved Brimstone 2 was expected to enter service in October 2012 , but problems with the new warhead from TDW and the ROXEL rocket motor put back the planned date to November 2015 . MBDA is working on the targeting of swarms of small boats under the name Sea Spear . The RAF intend to fit Brimstone to their Eurofighter Typhoons , and planned to integrate it with their Harriers until they were withdrawn from service in 2010 . MBDA is studying the use of Brimstone on ships , attack helicopters , UAVs , and from surface launchers ; it will be integrated on the Lockheed Martin F - 35 Lightning II when the F - 35B enters British service . The United States , France and India have expressed interest in buying Brimstone for their aircraft , but Saudi Arabia is the only export customer as of 2015.The cost per missile has been quoted as £ 175,000 (  263,000 ) each in 2015 , or ' over £ 100,000 ' .  - BAE Systems plc is a British multinational defence, security and aerospace company. Its headquarters are in London in the United Kingdom and it has operations worldwide. It is among the world's largest defence companies; it was ranked as the third-largest based on applicable 2015 revenues. Its largest operations are in the United Kingdom and United States, where its BAE Systems Inc. subsidiary is one of the six largest suppliers to the US Department of Defense. Other major markets include Australia, India and Saudi Arabia. The company was formed on 30 November 1999 by the £7.7 billion merger of two British companies: Marconi Electronic Systems (MES)  the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the General Electric Company plc (GEC)  and British Aerospace (BAe)  an aircraft, munitions and naval systems manufacturer.  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - Matra BAe Dynamics was formed in August 1996 by merger of half the missile business of Matra Defense of France and BAe Dynamics (a division of British Aerospace) of the UK and was Europe's largest manufacturer of missiles and UAVs.    What is the relationship between 'brimstone ' and 'marconi electronic systems'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Brimstone' and 'Marconi Electronic Systems' lies in the development and manufacturing of the Brimstone missile. Brimstone is an air-launched ground attack missile developed by MBDA for Britain's Royal Air Force. MBDA, a European developer and manufacturer of missiles, was formed by the merger of several companies, including the French Aérospatiale-Matra Missiles (which was part of Marconi Electronic Systems), Italian Alenia Marconi Systems (now Leonardo), and British Matra BAe Dynamics (of BAE Systems) in December 2001. Before the formation of MBDA, Marconi Electronic Systems, a British company specializing in defense electronics and naval shipbuilding, was one of the key players in the industry. Its subsidiary, Matra Marconi Space (now Airbus Defense and Space), later merged with other European companies to form MBDA. The Brimstone missile is thus a product of the collaborative effort between these merged entities, which have their roots in companies like Marconi Electronic Systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Jumping on your bike, even in the city, is becoming increasingly popular--- in London, for example, cycle use has more than doubled in the past ten years. So, which is the best bike for you?     If you're traveling to work, a folding bike such as one of the models here is suitable unless you're cycling more than a couple of miles, in which case it might be uncomfortable . You can take a fold-up on the train and as it goes indoors with you, it's secure .     For longer journeys, a road bike with drop handlebars and narrow tyres is a good choice. Try Specialized, from PS400. Note that the riding position encourages you to look downwards, which can be dangerous.     Mountain bikes are best suited to off-road travel; their fat and strong tyres are good for climbing steep, muddy slopes . Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300.     A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres. Ridgeback makes great hybrids, from around PS350.     For a classic sit-up-and-beg bike, it's still hard to beat Pashley, which makes its bikes by hand. Expect to pay around PS500.     Once you've picked your bike, sizing is crucial or you may suffer back or neck pain. A famous bike shop will help you choose the right size frame. The height of the seat should be adjusted carefully---again, a good shop will advise. If you only plan to cycle once or twice a month, you can choose a lower-priced bike, but for regular use, paying more means better quality: cheaper bikes need more frequent adjustment of brakes and gears   ---and tend to be heavier, too. Finally, items such as mudguards  aren't always included. Question: The main purpose of this passage is to   _  . Options: A: give advice on how to choose a bike B: advertise some famous bike brands C: encourage people to go to work by bike D: introduce the advantages of different bikes","output":"To determine the main purpose of the passage, let's take a closer look at the content presented: 1. The article mentions the growing popularity of cycling. 2. It discusses folding bikes and their suitability for short commutes and security. 3. It talks about road bikes, mountain bikes, hybrid bikes, and classic bikes, providing examples of good brands and their costs. 4. The article emphasizes the importance of sizing and choosing a quality bike, as well as additional features like mudguards. Based on this information, the main purpose of the passage can be concluded as: A: give advice on how to choose a bike This option encompasses the main points of the article, as it provides information on different types of bikes, their uses, and factors to consider when purchasing one. The other options are too focused on specific aspects and do not address the overall content of the passage."},{"instruction":"The Maldives faces the threat of extinction from rising sea levels, but the government said on Thursday it was looking to the future with plans to build homes and a golf course that float. An increase in sea levels of just 18 to 59 centimeters would make the Maldives -- a nation of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean -- virtually uninhabitable by 2100, the UN's climate change panel has warned. President Mohamed Nasheed has vowed a fight for survival, and last month he signed a deal with a Dutch company to study proposals for a floating structure that could support a convention centre, homes and an 18-hole golf course. \\"It is still early stages and we are awaiting a report on the possibility,\\" a government official said.

I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did. I was not an easy person to love. Question: The person most likely feels like: === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"(2). He was devastated at the loss of his wife and friend. The person in this scenario is feeling devastated at the loss of his wife and friend. The suddenness of his wife leaving him and entering into a relationship with a close friend on the same day left him completely blindsided and in shock. He was not only grieving the loss of his wife but also the loss of his best friend, which in this case, was his wife. The pain of losing her family, whom he cared about, deepened his feelings of devastation and loss. His grief and emotional turmoil led him to do something he is not proud of: creating a fake Facebook account to check on his ex-wife's page and communicate with her through instant messaging. He thought that talking to her, even if not as himself, would help him cope with the loss and somehow keep her in his life. Unfortunately, this action only made matters worse, as it led him to discover photos of her with someone else, which deeply hurt him. His desperation to hold onto the connection with his wife eventually led to him being discovered, as he accidentally revealed his location and was called out by his ex-wife. He recognizes that he was the grieving idiot unwilling to give up, and it only caused him further pain. Despite everything, the person now just wishes for his ex-wife's happiness, admitting he was not an easy person to love and questioning why she stayed with him as long as she did. The love and attachment he felt for her, as well as the realization that he may not have been the best partner, make it clear that this individual was, and likely still is, feeling devastated at the loss of his wife and friend."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One morning he set out with his young son to sell the horse before it died. The father and the son walked because the farmer did not want the horse to be too tired . They met two men on the road. They said, \\"Why are you walking, farmer? You have a horse. It's a long way to get to the market. \\"The farmer knew that this was true, so he rode on the horse while his son walked. Then they met two old ladies. \\"What are you doing up there, farmer? Can't you see how tired your son is? \\"So the farmer got down, and let his son ride on it. Twenty minutes later, three old men stopped them. One said, \\"Why are you walking, farmer? Get up; it's too hot for an old man like you to walk today. \\"So the farmer got up behind his son and they went on riding. Some time later, a young woman passed them. \\"Why aren't you walking?\\"She asked, \\"It isn't far to the market. Give your poor old horse a rest. \\" So the farmer and his son got down once again. It is a fact that you cannot please all the people all the time. What did the writer really want to tell us? A) The old man was a fool B) The horse was old and was going to die C) It is right to listen to others D) It is impossible for a man to make everyone satisfied all the time. Answer:","output":"The writer really wants to tell us that it is impossible for a man to make everyone satisfied all the time (Option D). Throughout the story, the old farmer and his son encounter various people who give them advice on how to travel to the market. Each time they listen to someone's advice and adjust their actions accordingly, they later meet someone else who criticizes them for those very actions. This story serves as a reminder that people will always have differing opinions and perspectives on any given situation. It is impossible to please everyone at once, and trying to do so may result in constant confusion and dissatisfaction. It is essential to use one's judgment and make decisions based on what is most sensible and reasonable. The options A, B, and C are not the primary messages of the story. Although the old man and the horse are both described as old and the horse's impending death is mentioned (Option B), it does not convey the central theme of the story. Option A implies that the old man's actions are foolish, but the story does not denigrate the old man; instead, it highlights the futility of trying to please everyone. Finally, Option C suggests listening to others is the right thing to do, but the story demonstrates that unquestioningly following everyone else's input can leave one in a never-ending cycle of conflicting advice. The moral of the story is that we should be aware that pleasing everyone is an unattainable goal and focus on making well-informed decisions that satisfy our own needs and values while remaining open to constructive feedback."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which team had less people with an increased blood flow to the muscles before the match?  There was a soccer match between Red team and Blue team. Blue team got there early, warmed up properly and were ready for the game. Red team arrived late and almost skipped warming up entirely. Costly decision, as it turns out, because they lost.  Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).

Nick knew that smoking could lead to a variety of serious health issues, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and emphysema. Additionally, he was aware that smoking was a difficult habit to quit, and he didn't want to see Jeffrey struggle with such an addiction. Step 1: Gather Information To help Jeffrey resist the urge to smoke, Nick started by gathering information about the harmful effects of cigarettes and the benefits of quitting. He believed that if Jeffrey was well-informed about the risks and consequences associated with smoking, it would create a strong foundation for him to resist temptation. Step 2: Be Supportive and Encouraging Nick made sure to be a supportive and encouraging friend for Jeffrey throughout the process. He shared his concerns about the dangers of smoking, while also highlighting how proud he was of Jeffrey for making the decision to quit. This created a positive atmosphere for Jeffrey, making it easier for him to give up cigarettes. Step 3: Offer Alternative Coping Mechanisms Knowing that many people turn to smoking as a way to cope with stress, Nick researched alternative coping mechanisms that would help Jeffrey manage his daily stressors without resorting to cigarettes. This included recommending healthy activities, such as exercise, yoga, or meditation. Step 4: Share Success Stories To further motivate Jeffrey, Nick shared stories of people who successfully quit smoking. Seeing these examples gave Jeffrey hope that he, too, could overcome his addiction to cigarettes. Step 5: Monitor Progress By keeping track of Jeffrey's progress, Nick was able to celebrate small victories and remind him of how far he had come in his journey to quit smoking. This helped keep Jeffrey motivated and focused on his goal. Step 6: Be Patient and Understanding Nick understood that quitting smoking was a difficult and often slow process. He remained patient and empathetic to Jeffrey's struggles, offering support and encouragement whenever needed. Through these steps, Nick played a crucial role in helping Jeffrey quit smoking. Over time, Jeffrey experienced the benefits of nicotine withdrawal, such as improved lung function, a decreased risk of heart disease, and an overall healthier lifestyle.

The Ozarks in Missouri, and the  more massive and younger Colorado Rockies. He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more.  and a hint : About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock.  Please answer this question : Which mountains have a larger percent of sedimentary rock? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Ozarks have a larger percentage of sedimentary rock, particularly limestone, as compared to the Colorado Rockies. The Ozarks, located primarily in Missouri and Arkansas, are part of a large plateau mainly composed of sedimentary rocks, including limestone, dolomite, sandstone, and shale. Because of the high percentage of limestone, the Ozarks region features numerous caves, sinkholes, and springs; which contributes to its karst landscape. On the other hand, the Colorado Rockies are part of the larger Rocky Mountains range, which is predominantly composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks, such as granite and gneiss. Although sedimentary rocks can be found in some areas of the Rocky Mountains, they represent a smaller percentage in comparison to the Ozarks. Hence, based on the given information and the geological composition of both mountain ranges, the Ozarks have a larger percentage of sedimentary rocks, particularly limestone, which forms cave systems and contributes to the unique karst landscape that Peter enjoyed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Nobody was asking Gary Bauer such questions that day (except perhaps for pointed contrast), because the obvious hook for these questions is Bush's alleged hypocrisy. Sentence 2: No one cared about what Bush did. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence, but they share a related theme with different focuses and implications. To better understand their relationship, let's analyze each sentence in detail: 1. Sentence 1: \\"Nobody was asking Gary Bauer such questions that day (except perhaps for pointed contrast), because the obvious hook for these questions is Bush's alleged hypocrisy.\\" This sentence discusses how no one was asking Gary Bauer certain questions, possibly related to Bush's alleged hypocrisy. It suggests that there is a specific context where questions are being asked or issues are being discussed, and the questions directed at Gary Bauer serve as a means of creating a pointed contrast. It implies that Bush's potential hypocrisy is the central issue in this particular setting. 2. Sentence 2: \\"No one cared about what Bush did.\\" This sentence is a somewhat exaggerated summation of people's attitudes towards Bush's actions. It claims that nobody has any interest or concern in Bush's activities, which may or may not refer to the alleged hypocrisy mentioned in the first sentence. While both sentences share a focus on Bush and the (possible) lack of scrutiny or concern towards his actions, they differ in their emphasis and scope. Sentence 1 discusses how the context of asking questions to Gary Bauer is influenced by Bush's alleged hypocrisy and how it serves as an essential element in the conversation. In contrast, Sentence 2 broadly asserts that no one is concerned with Bush's actions outside of the specific context found in Sentence 1. In summary, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, but both share a related theme. Sentence 1 explores how Bush's alleged hypocrisy is an important element in a specific context of asking questions to Gary Bauer, while Sentence 2 is a general claim about people's indifference towards Bush's actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Concurrently, David is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck. In 1965, a young Mossad agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in East Berlin to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold. Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel—infamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War II—and bring him to Israel to face justice.

The dog was drowned by the boy. Does the word \\"be\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"To analyze if the word \\"be\\" means the same thing in both sentences, let's break down the sentences and examine their structures: 1. \\"I shall be writing to you soon.\\" In this sentence, \\"be\\" is used as an auxiliary verb in the future continuous tense (shall be + verb-ing). \\"Be\\" helps to form the tense that indicates an ongoing action in the future. Here, \\"be\\" is primarily a grammatical function. 2. \\"The dog was drowned by the boy.\\" In this sentence, \\"was\\" is the past tense form of the verb \\"be,\\" and it is combined with the past participle \\"drowned\\" to form the passive voice structure. The passive voice highlights the importance of the action and its recipient rather than the person performing the action. In this context, \\"be\\" is also part of a grammatical function. In conclusion, while the specific form of \\"be\\" differs between the two sentences (as \\"be\\" in the first sentence and \\"was\\" in the second), the underlying meaning and purpose of the word are relatively similar in that they both serve as auxiliary verbs to create specific grammatical structures (future continuous tense and passive voice)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was a student-athlete at Michigan State from 2002 to 2006. As a once highly-touted recruit, Stanton made a significant impact while playing for the Michigan State Spartans under head coach John L. Smith and, later, under Mark Dantonio during Stanton's final year.  During his tenure at Michigan State, Drew Stanton held the position of quarterback and showcased his skills as a dual-threat player, with both excellent passing and rushing abilities. Stanton's playing style helped him establish himself as a vital component of the Spartans' offensive strategy.  Stanton's college career showcased impressive statistics. In his sophomore year (2004), he was named the starting quarterback and threw for a total of 3,077 yards with 22 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He also managed to rush for 687 yards and five touchdowns. In 2005, despite some injuries, Stanton still managed to accumulate 3,129 total yards of offense and participated in a total of 25 touchdowns, which included both passing and rushing scores. Finally, in his senior year (2006), under new head coach Mark Dantonio, Stanton threw for 1,807 yards with 12 touchdowns, while also rushing for an additional 445 yards and five touchdowns. During his time at Michigan State University, Stanton led the Spartans to several key victories, including their monumental 41-38 victory over rival Notre Dame in 2005. Stanton's performances throughout his college career garnered the attention of NFL scouts, ultimately leading to his selection as the 43rd overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. In summary, Drew Stanton can be remembered as an important and dynamic quarterback who played an influential role in the Michigan State Spartans' college football team during the mid-2000s. His college career provided a strong foundation for his subsequent NFL career, where he played for several teams such as the Detroit Lions, Indianapolis Colts, Arizona Cardinals, Cleveland Browns, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her voice trembled with emotion as she recounted the heart-wrenching journey her family had taken since that tragic night when their lives changed forever. Irish native Natasha McShane, 23 years old at the time, had come to Chicago with dreams of advancing her academic career and pursuing new opportunities. She met her friend Stacy Jurich through the exchange program, and the two quickly formed a strong bond. Little did they know that their innocent decision to walk home together one fateful evening would lead to a nightmare that would haunt them for the rest of their lives. Prosecutors revealed the shocking details of the attack, showcasing the brutality and heartlessness of Heriberto Viramontes. The 37-year-old offender ambushed the two young women from behind and delivered merciless blows to their heads with a baseball bat. The sheer force of the impact left McShane and Jurich lying helplessly on the ground, their heads cracked open with pools of blood surrounding them. As McShane's family members broke down in tears and Jurich's family members comforted each other during the emotional court proceedings, it was clear that the trauma inflicted upon the victims would never be forgotten. While Stacy Jurich survived the assault with numerous injuries that required extensive rehabilitation, Natasha McShane suffered life-altering brain damage. She remains in a vegetative state to this day, incapable of walking, talking, or even recognizing her loved ones. In his closing arguments, Assistant State's Attorney John Maher described the horrific nature of the crime to the court and emphasized the need to hold Viramontes accountable for his actions. \\"Natasha McShane went from being a vibrant and intelligent young woman full of life to one who is completely dependent on others for her most basic needs,\\" Maher said passionately. \\"This heinous act of violence has left her in a living purgatory, and we must ensure that justice is served for her, her friend Stacy, and their families.\\" In delivering the 90-year sentence, Judge Jorge L. Alonso highlighted the unfathomable pain and suffering that Viramontes had caused his victims and their families. He expressed his hope that the lengthy sentence would serve as a strong deterrent to others, sending a clear message that violent acts of this nature would not be tolerated by society. As Viramontes was led away in handcuffs, the victims and their families embraced one another, their grief intertwined with relief that the man responsible for altering the course of their lives in such a devastating way would spend the rest of his days behind bars. While the sentencing brought a semblance of closure for the families, the long and arduous road to healing still lies ahead. The physical and emotional wounds inflicted upon Natasha McShane and Stacy Jurich may never fully heal, serving as painful reminders of the unimaginable cruelty that exists in the world. And for the McShane family, returning to their daughter's bedside each day, the heartache of losing the vibrant and thriving young woman they once knew will linger with them for the rest of their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

Felix laments that his third wife left him a few years earlier.Within a couple hours of driving, the two lose the directions to the wedding, realizing that Felix's suitcase was left back at the car rental agency. Making matters worse, the empty rental car rolls down a hillside and explodes.Felix and Oscar set off on foot along the desert highway, and no other cars come by for hours. They finally get picked up by a Mexican farmer, who asks them to drive his truck to a nearby gas station. They are soon stopped and arrested by a phalanx of police who find many illegal immigrants in the back of the truck.The local sheriff deduces that the two are not criminals and lets them go. Felix calls relatives at the wedding site and learns that they are five hours off course, so he and Oscar decide to spend the night in their current town.Felix and Oscar go off to a local bar, where Oscar charms a couple ladies somewhat younger than they are, named Thelma and Holly, and Felix goes along. The two couples dance, until the ladies suddenly need to leave.The next morning, they get a ride with an older man who is heading to the town where the wedding is being held. Alas, he soon dies after driving the car very slowly for a few miles. Police show up and take Felix and Oscar back to town, where the same sheriff from before again...

Answer the question Four students compared the total mass of the products to the total mass of the reactants after performing three trials of the same chemical reaction. Each student concluded that the total mass of the products was slightly less than the total mass of the reactants. Each student proposed a different explanation as follows. Student 1: The reaction converted some of the reactant mass to energy. Student 2: The chemical reaction produced a gas that escaped. Student 3: Some of the mass measurements were made with insufficient precision. Student 4: Heat released during the reaction caused the volume of the products to increase.Which students offered the most reasonable explanations?","output":"To find the most reasonable explanations, let's analyze each student's proposal step by step while considering the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system during chemical reactions. 1. Student 1: The reaction converted some of the reactant mass to energy. - While the mass-energy equivalence principle (E=mc^2) shows that mass can be converted to energy, this is typically not a factor in ordinary chemical reactions. Mass-energy conversion usually occurs in nuclear reactions. So, this explanation is unlikely. 2. Student 2: The chemical reaction produced a gas that escaped. - This explanation is plausible because if a gas is produced during the reaction and it's not adequately contained, the gas can escape, leading to a lower total mass of products measured compared to the mass of reactants. 3. Student 3: Some of the mass measurements were made with insufficient precision. - This explanation is also plausible because if the students did not measure the mass accurately, it could create an appearance of a mass discrepancy between reactants and products. 4. Student 4: Heat released during the reaction caused the volume of the products to increase. - Although heat might cause an increase in volume, it does not account for the decrease in total mass. Therefore, this explanation does not address the observed mass difference. Based on the analysis, Students 2 and 3 offered the most reasonable explanations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  Despite William Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth.  Guess a valid title for it!

Read this: Homer refers to the \\"Hellenes\\" (/ˈhɛliːnz/) as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia, with its warriors under the command of Achilleus. The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the great deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the \\"Greeks\\" who later came to be known as \\"Hellenes\\". Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus and the word probably means \\"sacrificers\\" (compare Gothic saljan, \\"present, sacrifice\\"). There is currently no satisfactory etymology of the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name Selloi changed to Sellanes and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However this etymology connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. The name Hellenes seems to be older and it was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris). According to the legend it was founded after the Trojan War by the eponymous Amphictyon, brother of Hellen. Is the name more ancient than other group names in the area ? What is the answer?

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee. Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is selecting the right type of coffee beans for the desired flavor and strength of the coffee. Coffee beans come in various types, origins, roast levels, and flavors, and the choice of beans plays a crucial role in determining the final taste and aroma of the brewed coffee. Here's a more detailed explanation of the process, including the missing first step: 1. Selecting and purchasing coffee beans:    - Choose between Arabica and Robusta beans, which have different taste profiles and caffeine levels. Arabica beans tend to have a smoother and more delicate flavor, while Robusta beans are known for their stronger, more robust character.    - Look for the origin of the beans, as it can affect the flavor. Beans from Central and South America have a light to medium body with a bright acidity, African beans typically offer fruity and floral notes, and Indonesian beans are known for their earthy and spicy flavors.    - Consider the roast level, which can range from light to dark. Light and medium roasts preserve the beans' original flavors, while dark roasts create a more robust and bitter taste that can mask the beans' nuances. 2. The water is poured into the machine at the back. 3. Coffee beans are put into a grinder. 4. The grinder is activated, ensuring the ground coffee has a consistent texture which suits the brewing method being used (e.g., coarse grind for French press, medium grind for drip coffee makers, fine grind for espresso machines). 5. A filter is put into the coffee maker, which can be made of paper, metal, or cloth, depending on the desired flavor and brewing method. 6. The ground coffee is put into the filter, typically in a ratio of about 2 tablespoons per 6 ounces of water for regular-strength coffee, although personal preferences may vary. 7. Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to counteract bitterness and enhance the coffee's flavor profile. 8. The top of the machine is closed, ensuring proper pressure and water distribution during the brewing process. 9. The power is turned on, activating the coffee maker and heating the water to the optimal temperature, commonly 195-205 °F (90-96 °C). 10. The water passes through the grounds, extracting soluble flavor compounds, oils, and aroma, which then combine with the water to create the final brewed coffee. The proper selection of coffee beans, along with following each step with care and precision, will result in a rich and flavorful cup of coffee that any coffee enthusiast will appreciate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What's the full name of the man who suggested the Chili Peppers record in Houdini's former mansion?  Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For more than 30 days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment...

In spite of a short-lived mainstream career spanning seven years, he was one of the most influential guitarists in the revival of blues in the 1980s. AllMusic describes him as \\"a rocking powerhouse of a guitarist who gave blues a burst of momentum in the '80s, with influence still felt long after his tragic death.\\" Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan began playing guitar at the age of seven, inspired by his older brother Jimmie. Context: In May 1969, after leaving the Brooklyn Underground, Vaughan joined a band called the Southern Distributor. He had learned The Yardbirds' \\"Jeff's Boogie\\" and played the song at the audition. Mike Steinbach, the group's drummer, commented: \\"The kid was fourteen. We auditioned him on 'Jeff's Boogie,' really fast instrumental guitar, and he played it note for note.\\" Although they played pop rock covers, Vaughan conveyed his interest in the addition of blues songs to the group's repertoire; he was told that he wouldn't earn a living playing blues music and the band parted ways. Later that year, bassist Tommy Shannon walked into a Dallas club and heard Vaughan playing guitar. Fascinated by the skillful playing, which he described as \\"incredible even then\\", Shannon borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within a few years, they began performing together in a band called Krackerjack.  In February 1970, Vaughan joined a band called Liberation, which was a nine-piece group with a horn section. Having spent the past month briefly playing bass with Jimmie in Texas Storm, he had originally auditioned as bassist. Impressed by Vaughan's guitar playing, Scott Phares, the group's original guitarist, modestly became the bassist. In mid-1970, they performed at the Adolphus Hotel in downtown Dallas, where ZZ Top asked them to perform. During Liberation's break, Vaughan jammed with ZZ Top on the Nightcaps song \\"Thunderbird\\". Phares later described the performance: \\"They tore the house down. It was awesome. It was one of those magical evenings. Stevie fit in like a glove on a hand.\\"  Attending Justin F. Kimball High School during the early 1970s, Vaughan's late-night gigs contributed to his neglect in his studies, including music theory; he would often sleep during class. His musical career pursuit was disapproved by many of the school's administrators, but he was also encouraged by many people to strive for a career in art, including his art teacher. In his sophomore year, he attended an evening class for experimental art at Southern Methodist University, but bailed when it conflicted with rehearsal. Vaughan later spoke of his dislike of the school and stated that he had to receive a daily note from the principal about his grooming. Question: Was Vaughan interested in art? Answer:","output":"Yes, Vaughan was interested in art. He attended an evening class for experimental art at Southern Methodist University during his sophomore year at high school, and he was encouraged by people, including his art teacher, to strive for a career in art. However, he eventually left the art class due to conflicts with his rehearsal schedule."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A software can determine the location of the eyes and tell where the user is looking on the screen. It even knows which image he is looking at.

A pocketwatch A:","output":"Title: The Ballad of the Crimson Pocketwatch In a small, strife-ridden border town in late 19th-century Mexico, there exists a legend of a cold-hearted killer named El Indio, notorious for his dueling prowess and cruel tactics. Few have seen El Indio in person and lived to tell the tale, except those who have heard the haunting melody that always precedes his deadly duels – a melody that emerges from an ornate crimson pocketwatch. One day, a mysterious young woman named Isabella arrives in the town, seemingly determined to settle an old score. She is seeking El Indio, the killer of her father who was once a skilled gunfighter himself. Driven by a burning desire for revenge, she begins her search for the enigmatic duelist and the crimson pocketwatch. As Isabella delves further into the town's secrets, she learns more about the past of El Indio and the crimson pocketwatch. The pocketwatch once belonged to a powerful shaman who imbued it with ancient magic to control time. When the shaman passed away, his descendants safeguarded the pocketwatch until it fell into the hands of El Indio. The pocketwatch not only serves as El Indio's morbid orchestra but also has the power to slow down time, giving him a significant advantage in duels. Unable to best El Indio with her own skills, Isabella seeks guidance from a blind, old apothecary who once studied under the same shaman that created the pocketwatch. Through a series of intense challenges and long-forgotten rituals, Isabella starts to awaken her innate magical abilities. At the same time, she forms an unexpected bond with a charismatic and morally complex outlaw, Pedro, who has his own reasons for wanting to see El Indio vanquished. Eventually, El Indio catches wind of Isabella's pursuit and confronts her in a tense standoff. With her newfound powers and Pedro's support, Isabella manages to shatter the crimson pocketwatch and neutralize El Indio's devious advantage. The shocking truth about Pedro's connection to El Indio and the shaman lineage is finally revealed, adding layers of emotional weight to their battle. Now on equal footing, the fabled gunslingers engage in a breathtaking, climactic duel to finally put an end to the legend of the crimson pocketwatch. Through sheer grit and determination, Isabella overcomes her fears and emerges victoriously, avenging her father's death and breaking the terrible spell that once haunted the town."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relation. The base of the triangle is barely there. At the apex is Marie, a serious, short and lean tomboy with a Belmondo-like facial structure. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquette, chubby -- I dare say fat -- and desirous for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of her chubbiness, boys don't seem interested and it pains her. The other leg of the apex is a beautiful \\"fille fatale\\" blonde vamp. She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool. Marie insinuates herself into the life of the vamp using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. The vamp has a reputation of being a whore, making out with any young male that orbits around her. Marie is not phased out by that reputation. Put a stress on reputation. The first half is set up. We get to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls. Eventually the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the topsy-turvy relations among the three. That's when unexpected things start to happen. It is a trademark of French films to drop nuggets of wisdom on the viewer. This one is no exception. Here it is about ceilings and the dying. See the film to learn more. The director says that the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful. That women-only sport is a metaphor for a girl's life: pretty and feminine on the surface while hard working and competitive underneath.

All the other ones I've been to around here and Cali have nothing on this lounge. With that said, the one on Maryland Pkwy is the same, just smaller and more narrow in size.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that wrote I know that my Redeemer liveth? is inside the article: The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\"  The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\"  should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and..., can you guess it ?

As independent contractors, Uber drivers' ability to make money comes from the amount of work they're able to secure during a shift. Making your driver wait undermines their ability to earn their wage and may make them more reluctant to give you a 5-star rating. Limit the amount of time you make your driver wait by being ready to hop in the car as soon as they arrive at your location.  Try to gather your belongings before requesting the Uber. When Uber sends you a notification that your driver is approaching, make your way to the pickup location (assuming that the location is the street outside of your address - if it's farther away than this, plan accordingly so that you can be there as soon as your driver arrives). Some Uber drivers work shifts of up to 19 hours at a time. Remember that any job comes with stresses that can be intense, and that your driver will appreciate you treating them with kindness and consideration even if they're working more manageable schedules than this.  Practice patience with your driver by keeping in mind that they're doing their best to get you to your destination as quickly and as comfortably as possible. If you have concerns with your driver's quality of service, try to bring them up non-confrontationally, or wait until the end of your journey to report them to Uber instead of bringing them up directly. Uber allows you to tip through the app, but you can give your driver a cash tip if you'd like. Consider carrying cash during your Uber rides to give your driver after pleasant service, and they will likely reciprocate by giving you a high star rating. Think of it as a \\"five-for-five\\" deal. Uber drivers offer up a valuable asset of their private property to service rides to customers. Remember that an Uber driver's car is different from a train or bus in this sense, and the person who uses the vehicle the most is the same person who has to maintain it. When riding in an Uber car, adopt a \\"leave no trace\\" policy whereby you commit to leaving the car in as good of a state as it was in when you entered it.  Don't leave food wrappers or drink bottles behind in your car. Be mindful of mess on your clothing or shoes and be conscientious about getting any dirt you track into an Uber out when you leave it. If your Uber has leather seats, ask your driver if they are comfortable with you putting your personal belonging on it before placing them there. Drunk and intoxicated customers can make for a very stressful experience for your driver, who may feel anxious about their passenger's potential belligerence or sickness. Remember that your driver's car is their personal space, and exercise whatever restraint you're able to in the car after a night out. If you fear you may fall ill in the car, let your driver know; they'll appreciate you giving them the opportunity to pull over and allow you to be sick somewhere that won't damage their car.","output":"Be ready when your Uber driver arrives, treat them kindly, keep their car clean, and consider tipping them to help them earn money and improve your rating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

Question: Process:  - A male and female bird mate - The female lays eggs - The eggs are incubated by the parents, by sitting on them, for weeks - The bird hatches from an egg - The parents feed them as the continue to grow - Develop flight feathers - The parents teach them to fly - After learning to fly they leave the nest to live on their own - The next year they breed beginning the cycle again -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are less birds that reproduce happens, how will it affect LESS birds.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation of fewer birds reproducing could have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Here's a step-by-step analysis of how this change may alter the process: 1. Fewer mating pairs: With fewer birds reproducing, there will be fewer mating pairs, which might lead to a reduction in genetic diversity. This can affect the resilience of their population to diseases and environmental changes. 2. Reduced number of eggs: As there are fewer mating pairs, the number of eggs laid will also decrease, leading to a decline in the overall population of the bird species. 3. Competition for resources and mates: With fewer birds reproducing, competition for resources such as food and nesting sites might decrease. This might increase the survival rate of newly hatched birds. However, it can also lead to reduced opportunities for mate selection, which can further impact the genetic diversity of the population. 4. Affected parental care: If the number of birds reproducing decreases significantly, the remaining birds might experience a change in parental care. They may need to adjust their behaviors and instincts to ensure the survival of the fewer offspring. 5. Development time: The decrease in competition for resources might lead to better conditions for the young birds to develop their flight feathers, potentially shortening the time it takes for them to become independent from their parents. 6. Teaching to fly: As resources are less scarce, the parent birds might have more time to effectively teach their offspring to fly, possibly increasing the success rate of the young birds when they eventually leave the nest. 7. Future breeding cycles: Since there are fewer birds to begin with, the population might take longer to recover and continue the breeding cycle. This can lead to long-term effects on the species' population size and growth rate. In conclusion, the perturbation of fewer birds reproducing can have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Some effects might seem beneficial, such as a decrease in competition for resources, but other effects, such as reduced genetic diversity and slower population recovery, could negatively impact the species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Enter the Shoguns: Japan's austere, ruthless, but statesmanlike new ruler, Yoritomo Minamoto, set up his government in Kamakura (just south of modern Tokyo), well away from the \\"softening\\" influence of court life that had been the undoing of his predecessor, Kiyomori. First of the national rulers to take the title of sei-i tai-shogun (\\"barbarian-subduing great general\\"), Minamoto expanded and consolidated his power by confiscating lands from some of the defeated Taira and redistributing them to his samurai vassals. Minamoto died in 1199, and the feudal structure passed intact to the tutelage of his widow's family, the Hojo, who were content to play regent to a figurehead shogun, in much the same way as the Fujiwara had done with the emperor. The fiction of Japanese imperial power had become infinitely extendable. The emperor at Kyoto — still seconded by a Fujiwara regent at court — legitimized a Minamoto who was himself a military dictator controlled by a Hojo regent. In a country where form and substance were inextricably interrelated, two things counted in politics: symbolic authority and real power. Neither could exist without the other. A thwarted Mongol invasion in 1274 weakened the Kamakura regime. The fighting brought none of the usual spoils of war that provincial warlords and samurai had come to expect as payment. And the treasury was empty after earthquake, famine, and plague had crippled the economy. Buddhist monasteries were using their private armies to support imperial ambitions to bring power back to Kyoto. Worst of all, the Kamakura warriors, resenting the way the Kyoto court referred to them as \\"Eastern barbarians,\\" sought refinement in a ruinous taste for luxury: extravagant feasts, rich costumes, and opulent homes. Kamakura was falling apart.

The ceiling of the apartment has a leak, which worsens on a daily basis. Matsubara complains to the janitor but he does nothing to fix the leak. She then tries to go to the floor above her apartment to find out the root of the leak, and discovers that the apartment is locked. Strange events then happen repeatedly: a red bag with a bunny on the front reappears no matter how often Yoshimi tries to dispose of it. Hair is found in tap water. Yoshimi gets glimpses of a mysterious long-haired girl who is of similar age to her daughter. Yoshimi discovers that the upstairs apartment, the source of the leak, was formerly the home of a girl named Mitsuko Kawai (æ²³å ç¾æ´¥å­ Kawai Mitsuko; Mirei Oguchi), who was Ikuko's age. She had attended the same kindergarten Ikuko now attends. Mitsuko was abandoned by her mother and vanished more than a year ago.

Convinced something eerie is happening, she decides to move but her lawyer convinces her that moving now would weaken her position greatly in her divorce. One evening, after Yoshimi finds that the red bag has reappeared in Ikuko's school bag, she heads to the roof of the building, and is drawn to the huge water tank. She notices that it was last inspected â and thus opened â over a year ago, on the day Mitsuko was last reported seen.

Objective: Treat dry or damage hair with bananas Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"Before presenting the solution, let's break down the problem: The objective is to treat dry or damaged hair using bananas. Bananas are known to have nutrients and vitamins that can nourish and moisturize the hair.  Now, let's consider the potential solutions: Solution A: 1. Peel one or two ripe bananas. 2. Mash the bananas until a smooth paste is formed. 3. Apply the banana paste to damp hair, ensuring that it is evenly distributed. 4. Cover hair with a shower cap and let the mixture sit for 15-30 minutes. 5. Rinse the hair thoroughly with water and shampoo to remove the banana paste. 6. Condition and style the hair as usual. Solution B: 1. Place banana peels directly on the hair and rub the insides of the peels along the strands. 2. Leave the banana peels on the hair for a couple of minutes. 3. Remove the banana peels and wash the hair with a mild shampoo. 4. Condition and style the hair as usual. In terms of naive physics reasoning, the more sound solution would be Solution A for the following justifications: 1. Mashing the bananas into a smooth paste (Solution A) would maximize the contact between the hair and banana nutrients, leading to better absorption and treatment of dry or damaged hair. In contrast, rubbing the insides of banana peels (Solution B) might not release enough nutrients and be less effective. 2. In Solution A, covering the hair with a shower cap and leaving the mixture on for an extended period (15-30 minutes) allows the nutrients to penetrate the hair shaft more effectively, thus treating the dry or damaged hair. In Solution B, leaving the peels on for just a few minutes may not provide enough time for the nutrients to make a significant impact. 3. Solution A uses one or two ripe bananas that are rich in nutrients, while Solution B only utilizes the peels, which may not contain as many beneficial nutrients for the hair. Therefore, using ripe bananas provides more nourishment. In conclusion, Solution A seems to be more sound due to the better absorption of nutrients, higher nutrient content, and effective exposure time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Bright blue Citi Bikes are becoming a fine sight in the New Yorker street. New Yorkers are gradually getting used to more pedaling  passengers on those blue Citi Bikes. But what about local bike shops ? Is City Bike booming at their expense? At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca, a manager who gave his name as \\"Ben W.\\" said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program. \\"It's getting more people on the road, more people learning about the sport and getting involved,\\" he said. An employee at Danny's Cycles in Gramercy said Citi Bike is a good option for people in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. \\"They can try out a bike without buying one:' James Ryan said. Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles. But for Frank's Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St., the bike-share program has been bad news. Owner Frank Arroyo said that his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was launched last month. Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes. However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. \\"People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,\\" he noted. Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. said at first he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, \\"I was happy to see people on bikes.\\" Farrell's early concerns were repeated by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. \\"It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to put into use:' Crooks said of Citi Bike. He said he worried about inexperienced riders' lack of awareness of biking rules and strong negative reaction from non-cyclists. However, he said, it's still too early to tell if his business has been impacted   . While it's possible bike-share will cause a drop in business, Crooks agreed that the idea is a positive step forward for New York City.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Cholesterol Controversy Shows Medicine Needs Big Data, Not Old Data On Monday, it sounded like the American Heart Association American Heart Association had taken IT advice from the Obama administration. The New York Times reported that a top cardiologist said an online calculator central to new guidelines that tell doctors when to prescribe cholesterol medicine is over-estimating people’s risk of heart attacks and strokes – thereby putting more patients on statin drugs, the now-generic medicines that were once the best-sellers for Pfizer and Merck. “I actually support probably 80% of what’s in these guidelines because they’ve taken major steps forward that are going to improve care,” says Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the critic whose analysis was published in The Lancet yesterday. The good: the new guidelines, from the AHA and American College of Cardiology, consider stroke risk in addition to that of a heart attacks; they guide doctors to use higher doses of statins; and they make the decision to give the drugs simpler, he says. But when Ridker started entering patients into the calculator, the results didn’t make sense to him. A 55-year-old man who smoked and had high blood pressure but not elevated cholesterol got a statin, and a 60-year-old woman with high cholesterol but no other risk factors would not. His concerns got more serious when his co-author, Brigham statistician Susan Cook, told him that she shared his concerns. Cook tested the calculator in data recorded from three big studies funded by the by the National Institutes of Health: the Women’s Health Study (WHS), the Physicians Health Study (PHS), and the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study. The risk of heart attack and stroke predicted by the AHA/ACC calculator was double that actually experienced by the people in these studies. And the full guideline analysis produced by the AHA and ACC seems to back up Ridker’s analysis. Deep in this document the guidelines committee tested its calculator against two clinical trials called MESA and REGARDS. I’ve included a graph of the MESA data in this post – it clearly shows that the risk calculator is again overestimating the risk to patients. As the guideline writers put it, on page 38: “Overprediction of events was noted in all validation groups, particularly for MESA and REGARDS.” From the ACC/AHA guidelines; the red lines represent the calculator, the blue lines the observed risk. The AHA and ACC have re-iterated their confidence in the calculator. Donald Lloyd-Jones, a cardiologist at Northwestern involved in writing the guidelines, says that the reason patients in MESA had a lower risk is because many of them started taking statins; the ten-year calculator is supposed to tell patients their risk without treatment. He also says the criticisms are “not fair” and that “these are some of the most heavily scrutinized documents” he has ever been involved with. The guidelines, which started as a government effort under the auspices of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, went through many levels of scientific peer review. Moreover, Lloyd-Jones says, the new guidelines do not suggest that doctors should be slaves to the risk calculator. The ten-year risk is driven by age, he says, but he himself would treat the woman who came out as low risk in Ridker’s example or someone who had an extreme family history and the guidelines include caveats encouraging doctors to think beyond the risk calculator, he says. Ridker counters that maybe people smoke less and eat better than in some of the older studies used to develop the risk calculator. Whatever reviews the AHA/ACC guidelines went through, the criticism not only from Ridker but from Steven Nissen, a past-president of the ACC, indicate that he calculator could have used broader vetting. Instead of a private peer-review, an open debate with the intention of validating the calculator before it became official would have avoided this controversy. But that’s only the first way in which this event argues for a movement beyond twentieth century science to something new. To cardiologists, who are largely in awe of the life-saving power of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it can be easy to forget how these medicines are viewed by much of the rest of the country and how controversial it is to suggest that a third of adults should be taking them, as these new guidelines do. There is a fundamental problem of medical science here. There is a good scientific rationale for taking statin drugs when risk is low and continuing them for decades. The risk of heart attack or stroke increases slowly as plaque builds up inside the artery walls and becomes inflamed. Slowing this process may take time. As evidence, patients with mutations in a gene called PCSK9 that caused them to have 15% lower levels of LDL cholesterol (the bad kind) had a 47% lower risk of heart attack. That’s half as much as a statin would decrease LDL or less, but these people walk around with lower cholesterol for their entire lives. That’s a huge potential benefit. But taking a statin for a long time is a huge leap of faith, because medical decisions are made based on clinical trials, big tests of drugs in people. In these studies, there is a huge mountain of evidence that statins save lives when given to people with heart disease– for instance, those who have already had a heart attack. And there is also strong evidence that those who have not had a heart attack but are at high risk can reduce their risk with a statin. But using statins to prevent a first heart attack or stroke can be controversial because in people who are at relatively low risk, you have to treat a lot of them to prevent one heart attack. This is where people who think the side effects of statins are worse than cardiologists generally believe or those who want to adhere stringently to the evidence from clinical trials can reasonably differ from some gung-ho statin advocates. What is really needed is a way to test medicines beyond the five-year timeframe of even a big clinical trial. The obvious way to do this would be with a nationally integrated electronic health record system that actively collects data and uses it for scientific research. But right now our electronic health records system is fragmented, with efforts only now underway to get data shared between different systems made by rivals like Epic Systems, Cerner Cerner, and AthenaHealth. Such systems could be used to do things like test and improve risk calculators, better track side effects, and monitor the real-world efficacy of drugs. Right now, we try to do that with insurance claims, which is far from a perfect way to move forward. Medicine needs good data science if it’s ever going to build on the certainty we get from clinical trials. (For more on this topic, see the embedded video from the Forbes Healthcare Summit.) Better EHRs would have an another impact here: instead of asking primary care doctors to calculate a patient’s risk themselves, the computer could automatically do it for them. Says Sanjay Kaul of Cedars Sinai Health System, one of cardiology’s great skeptics: “I remain skeptical of the use of risk calculator by clinicians to drive their decision to put their patients on statins, unless it is embedded in the EHR to be used at the point of care and it is coded as a ‘billable’ activity for reimbursement.” In the meantime, another drug-company-related note on the new guidelines. I’ve written before that the guidelines are indifferent to most drug makers because all the statins but AstraZeneca's AstraZeneca's Crestor are generic. They also may be bad for companies developing new drugs that block PCSK9 because they demand proof from clinical trials that a medicine reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke before it becomes widely used; that could hurt Amgen, Regeneron, Sanofi, and Pfizer. But there is a silver lining for those developing PCSK9 shots. If these guidelines do result in a lot more patients trying statins, there will be a lot more people who turn out to be unable to tolerate statins because they get muscle side effects or other issues. They would all be strong candidates for a PCSK9 shot if those drugs reach the market.","output":"A top cardiologist has claimed that an online calculator, central to new guidelines for prescribing cholesterol medication, is over-estimating people's risk of heart attacks and strokes, thereby putting more patients on statin drugs.

His comments have sparked discussions and speculations on which key positions he might address and which players' names are on his list of potential signings. The Need for Reinforcements Chelsea has been performing well in the Premier League, partly due to their tactical formation under Conte's leadership. However, their recent performances have shown that there might be a need for reinforcements in certain areas of the field, as injuries and suspensions have left some gaps in the team, ultimately affecting the quality of their play and, consequently, their results. Positions and Players of Interest One of the areas in which Chelsea could potentially strengthen is in their defense. Their current back line has shown some vulnerability, and Conte might look for a center-back or a left-back that can offer more stability and depth to the squad. It is rumored that several big names have been linked with a potential move to Chelsea, including Dutch center-backs Stefan de Vrij and Virgil van Dijk, as well as Premier League experienced players like Kieran Trippier and Danny Rose. The midfield is another area where the Blues may look to gain more creativity and grit through January signings. Conte may keep his eyes on players such as PSG's Adrien Rabiot, Nice's Jean-Michael Seri, or AS Roma's Lorenzo Pellegrini, all of whom offer different skill sets that can complement their existing midfield. Closing Thoughts The January transfer window brings a perfect opportunity for Antonio Conte to refresh and refuel his squad for the second half of the season. By reinforcing the weaker areas of the team, Chelsea can improve their chances of challenging for the Premier League title. While there is no guarantee that Chelsea will be able to secure all or any of their top targets during the January transfer window, one thing is for sure: Antonio Conte is serious about trying to strengthen his side, and his actions will be closely monitored by football fans worldwide"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 21 November 1975 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its release. The album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording. A Night at the Opera incorporates a wide range of styles, including ballads, songs in a music hall style, hard rock tracks and progressive rock influences. \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" is amongst Roger Taylor's most famous songs in the Queen catalogue. The song was initially taken as a joke by May, who thought that Taylor was not serious when he heard a demo recording.  Taylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later re-recorded by May on his Red Special. The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio version, and all released live versions. The revving sounds at the conclusion of the song were recorded by Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The lyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose Triumph TR4 was evidently the \\"love of his life\\". The song is dedicated to him, the album says: \\"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end\\".  When it came down to releasing the album's first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Mercury (author of the first single, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\") to allow it to be the B-side and reportedly locked himself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. This decision would later become the cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the B-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the main single did for Mercury.  The song was often played live during the 1977-81 period. Taylor sang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals. It was played in the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005 and the Rock the Cosmos Tour in 2008. Taylor would again play the song for his concerts with The Cross and solo tours, where instead of drums he played rhythm guitar.

Bewildered: The Portuguese could scarcely believe he had been sent off. Ronaldo was sent off for the seventh time in his career in the 75th minute of Sunday's 1-1 draw at San Mames after he raised his hand to Bilbao captain Carlos Gurpegi, who fell to the floor theatrically. He also confronted Bilbao midfielder Ander Iturraspe during an ugly melee. Ayza Gamez is understood to have originally stated that he sent Ronaldo off for the incident with Gurpegi but then changed his story to say he had dismissed him for pushing Iturraspe - a fracas the Bilbao player started. Valencia born referee Ayza Gamez has a reputation in Spain for being consistently poor. For the last three seasons he has finished far enough down the refereeing authority's end of season's rankings that he has been a major candidate to be relegated to the second tier. He doesn't have the arrogance of several of his even more unpopular colleagues and is liable to be pressured into making mistakes by players rather than erring because of an exaggerated desire to be the focus of every game - but he is seen as incompetent all the same. He fell over in the Athletic Bilbao vs Real Madrid game last weekend and that fits his reputation for not being in control. He is also criticized for lacking the character needed to officiate in the top flight. Madrid have complained previously over his failure to send Dani Alves for dissent in a match where he had booked the full-back but then allowed him to call him 'loco' (crazy) to his face. PETE JENSON. Squaring up: Ronaldo argues with Bilbao midfielder Ander Iturraspe, sparking a melee involving a number of players from both sides. Trouble: Ronaldo puts his head into the face of Iturraspe having swiped his hand across the face of Bilbao captain Carlos Gurpegi (left) Scrap: Ronaldo postures as the players square up to each other. Ronaldo has been banned for three matches and will miss his team's forthcoming fixtures against Villarreal, Getafe and Elche - a major blow in Real's bid to beat rivals Atletico Madrid and Barcelona to the title. The Portuguese, who turned 29 on Wednesday, was banned for one match for violent conduct and a further two matches for dissent as he walked from the field. He was also fined just under £1,000. However, the news that Ayza Gamez has been suspended will encourage Real in their appeal against Ronaldo's ban. The innocent one: Ronaldo stands back as the arguments carry on. Long walk off: Ronaldo leaves the pitch after being shown a straight red card. The Spanish Football Federation's Appeals Committee convenes on Friday to consider their argument. Ronaldo, the Ballon d'Or winner who has scored 32 goals in 31 matches this season, is still eligible to play in the Copa del Rey and featuring during the midweek 3-0 win over Atletico at the Bernabeu. He will also be able to play in next week's second leg. Wow! What a remarkable decision by the Spanish Refereeing Technical Committee. I wouldn’t like to be the next referee who officiates in a Real Madrid game. This is all about Madrid. The fact Miguel Angel Ayza Gamez has been given a one month suspension and told he cannot referee any more Madrid games indicates the power and influence they have. It may have been a harsh red, but we have seen those before. The chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee is Spanish too, so he will be taking an interest in this. It also comes out the day Cristiano Ronaldo has his appeal hearing, which suggest he will be treated with leniency. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. Cristiano Ronaldo was dismissed in Real Madrid's draw at Athletic Bilbao, and the referee, Miguel Angel Ayza Gamez, has been suspended amid suggestions that he changed his story of the incident. 2. The Spanish League's Refereeing Technical Committee (CTA) has suspended Gamez for a month and barred him from officiating Real Madrid matches this season. 3. Ronaldo has been banned for three matches and will miss his team's forthcoming fixtures against Villarreal, Getafe, and Elche due to the incident. 4. The suspension of Gamez may encourage Real Madrid in their appeal against Ronaldo's ban, as the Spanish Football Federation's Appeals Committee convenes on Friday to consider their argument."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. H      amburger Lane is a quarter-mile, palm-lined stretch of Baldwin Park, California, 30 minutes east of Los Angeles. Halfway down the block, a low-slung building covered in gray siding sits behind a security fence. Knowing what’s inside the little structure helps explain the street’s unusual name. It’s the top-secret corporate test kitchen for In-N-Out Burger, the iconic West Coast chain.      Lynsi Snyder, the company’s billionaire president, hovers over a set of double fryers and stove-top griddles. “To be honest, I don’t come here a whole lot,” she says. Given the clean counters and neatly tucked-away cooking utensils, it doesn’t look like anyone comes here often.      Which is probably not far off the mark. While McDonald’s and Burger King serve well over 80 different items, In-N-Out famously serves fewer than 15: burgers, cheeseburgers, fries, soda, milk shakes and the signature two-patty Double-Double. Snyder has added just one thing: hot chocolate in 2018. The company will make tweaks from time to time, like switching to a premium Kona coffee and healthier sunflower oil for cooking fries.      The October 31, 2018 issue of Forbes featuring In-N-Out's Lynsi Snyder.      But Snyder, who at 36 debuts on this year’s Forbes 400 as its youngest woman, with a net worth of 3 billion, fiercely embraces an imperviousness to change. “It’s not [about] adding new products. Or thinking of the next bacon-wrapped this or that. We’re making the same burger, the same fry,” says Snyder, wearing black lace-up combat boots and stacks of silver bracelets on both arms. “We’re really picky and strategic. We’re not going to compromise.”      In-N-Out is a culinary anachronism. It hasn’t evolved much since Snyder’s grandparents founded it in 1948. Buns are baked with slow-rising dough each morning. Three central facilities grind all the (never-frozen) meat, delivering daily to the 333 restaurants. Nearly all its locations are in California, and all are company owned. (In-N-Out does not franchise.) Heat lamps, microwaves and freezers are banned from the premises. The recipes for its burgers and fries have remained essentially the same for 70 years.      Consistency has earned it a passionate following. In-N-Out has become a fixture at Oscars after-parties. Its secret menu, like the option to order a burger “protein style”—lettuce leaves, no bun—is the least well-kept secret since the WikiLeaks cables. Top chefs like Gordon Ramsay, David Chang and Thomas Keller are all enthusiastic fans. The actor-cum-rapper Donald Glover has rhapsodized about In-N-Out in his lyrics. And in 2006 Paris Hilton got a DUI because, as she later explained, “I was just really hungry, and I wanted to have an In-N-Out burger.”      “They have a loyalty and an enthusiasm for the brand that very, very few restaurants can ever obtain,” says Robert Woolway, who handles restaurant deals for the L.A.-based investment bank FocalPoint Partners.      That loyalty is lucrative. An In-N-Out store outsells a typical McDonald’s nearly twice over, bringing in an estimated 4.5 million in gross annual sales versus McDonald’s 2.6 million. (In-N-Out, which is private, won’t comment on its financials.) In-N-Out’s profit margin (measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is an estimated 20%. That’s higher than In-N-Out’s East Coast rival Shake Shack (16%) and other restaurant chains that typically own their locations, like Chipotle (10.5%). Revenue should surpass 1 billion this year, roughly doubling in eight years, and the business is debt-free, according to the company. In-N-Out is conservatively worth 3 billion, and Snyder now owns virtually all of it after receiving chunks on her 25th, 30th and 35th birthdays (she got the last slice in 2017).      Snyder is an unlikely shepherd of her family’s business. By all rights, her uncle should be running In-N-Out, if not for his untimely death. She never graduated from college and lost her father to drug abuse. As a young woman, she battled through a period of alcohol and drug use and three di­vorces. Snyder, a devout Christian who sports tattoos of Bible ­verses, came out of those experiences drawn to In-N-Out’s long-standing stability—determined to change the company as little as possible, particularly the brand’s image of 1950s wholesomeness. After taking over in 2010, she embarked on a slow, steady expansion across the West, opening more than 80 stores in the same period that Five Guys, a close competitor, added more than 500 across America.      “I felt a deep call to make sure that I preserve those things that [my family] would want. That we didn’t ever look to the left and the right to see what everyone else is doing, cut corners or change things drastically or compromise,” says Snyder, who has spoken with the media only a handful of times. “I really wanted to make sure that we stayed true to what we started with. That required me to become a protector. A guardian.”      I      n 1948, Harry and Esther Snyder, Lynsi’s grandparents, opened the first In-N-Out, in Baldwin Park. It had no indoor seating, so Harry installed a two-way speaker box connected to the kitchen, creating an early drive-thru window. As Americans flooded the new U.S. highway system, In-N-Out, which was placing its restaurants alongside the new roads, took off. In southern California, In-N-Outs became a hangout for hot rod racers. From the early days, Harry and Esther were keen to keep as many aspects of the business in-house as they could. They butchered their own meat, started a wholesaling firm to stock up on paper supplies and used their own construction crew to build new stores.      In-N-Out grew gradually, reaching 18 locations, all in California, by the time Harry died in 1976. His younger son, Rich, took his spot; the elder son, Guy, Lynsi’s father, had been passed over. He had an ongoing problem with opioids after a motorcycle accident left him with chronic pain. He spent his days away from the company, drag racing or on his 115-acre ranch in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where Lynsi grew up.      In December 1993, Rich flew to see his niece Lynsi in a play at a ­private Christian school and then continued on to the opening of store No. 93 in Fresno, California. On the way home, the ten-passenger plane crashed, leaving no survivors. After his death, Esther became president, and Guy, who had separated from Lynsi’s mother earlier that year, took over as executive vice president and chairman.      During Guy’s six years as chairman, In-N-Out grew to 140 stores, with over 200 million in revenue. Yet he struggled personally. On Christmas Day 1995 he was arrested for public intoxication and illegally carrying a loaded firearm, which he had along with a switchblade knife and marijuana. Over the next few years he survived a drug-related heart attack and three drug overdoses before dying of heart failure (with hydrocodone in his system) in December 1999, at age 48.      “When he was sober, he was the best dad in the world. We had our time cut short,” says Lynsi, who has a scroll with the words “Daddy’s Girl” tattooed on her right shoulder.      Before her father died, Lynsi had worked for a few months at an In-N-Out in Redding, California, separating leaves of lettuce and working the register. Soon after, the 18-year-old married and moved close to the company’s headquarters in Baldwin Park to take a job at In-N-Out’s corporate merchandising department, approving projects like T-shirt designs. Lynsi fell into a year-long stretch of alcohol and marijuana use, and she and her husband divorced after a few years. A second short-lived marriage followed.      “It was like a black-sheep era of my life,” she says. “By the time I hit 22, it was pretty much over.”      Lynsi rotated through departments at In-N-Out to learn the business. As Lynsi educated herself on how it worked, Esther, then in her 80s, ran day-to-day operations. Then Esther died too, in 2006.      Mark Taylor, a longtime In-N-Out executive (who is also Lynsi’s brother-in-law), became company president, turning over the role to Lynsi in 2010. At age 27, Lynsi was running In-N-Out, which was generating an estimated 550 million in sales at 251 locations.      Her third marriage came soon after, this time to a race car driver. (It’s in the blood: Lynsi also drag races competitively.) They divorced in 2014, followed by her fourth marriage. “The things that I’ve been through forced me to be stronger,” she says. “When you persevere, you end up developing more strength.”      I      n In-N-Out restaurant is a time capsule. The red-and-white color scheme hasn’t changed since the 1950s, and the chrome tables and vinyl chairs are poodle-skirt-era throwbacks. Palm trees are a frequent motif—printed on the company’s plates, painted onto restaurant walls—a nod both to In-N-Out’s California roots and to Grandpa Snyder’s favorite movie, It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, from 1963. Bible verse numbers have appeared on burger wrappers and cups since 1985, and Snyder has added two more: Proverbs 24:16 (for those unfamiliar: “ ... the wicked shall fall into mischief”) to the fries container and Luke 6:35 (“But love ye your enemies, and do good”) to coffee cups.      Over the past 30 years, the price of the Double-Double hasn’t even kept up with inflation. In 1989 the sandwich cost 2.15, or about 4.40 in current dollars. It costs 3.85 today. A combo meal (Double-Double, fries, drink) goes for 7.30, compared with 10.94 for Shake Shack’s standard double-burger patty and fries.      So how does In-N-Out maintain its margins? To start, the limited menu means reduced costs for raw ingredients. The company also saves money by buying wholesale and grinding the beef in-house. By doing its own sourcing and distribution, it likely saves 3% to 5% in food costs a year. It cuts out an estimated 6% to 10% of total costs by owning most of its properties—many bought years ago—and not paying rent. In-N-Out picks its locations carefully, clustering them near one another and close to highways to lower delivery costs while also avoiding pricey urban cores. It has just one location within the city limits of Los Angeles and one in San Francisco, while many Shake Shacks are smack in the center of town.      While much has stayed the same at In-N-Out, Snyder has made some changes. She moved the company into Texas for the first time in 2011 and into Oregon four years later. Last November, In-N-Out announced it would expand to Colorado—once it finishes building a new regional headquarters and a patty-making facility there, likely by 2020. New Mexico may be next, a few years after Colorado, Snyder says, since the new supply center is nearby. Snyder still abides by the long-standing In-N-Out rule that all new restaurants fall within a day’s drive from the nearest warehouse, so meat and other ingredients stay fresh.      “I don’t see us stretched across the whole U.S. I don’t see us in every state. Take Texas—draw a line up and just stick to the left. That’s in my lifetime,” Snyder says. “I like that we’re sought after when someone’s coming into town. I like that we’re unique. That we’re not on every corner. You put us in every state and it takes away some of its luster.”      No matter where In-N-Out goes, it has to deal with competitors with entrenched positions. In Texas it faces 68-year-old Whataburger. The 2-billion-in-revenue company has 674 locations in the Lone Star State—In-N-Out has just 36 there—after opening 116 more in Texas since In-N-Out came in. “Certainly we’d love for them to go somewhere else. But they’re welcome to compete,” says Preston Atkinson, Whataburger’s CEO. “They’re doing something different than we are. In-N-Out has got a limited menu.” But In-N-Out is betting that its small number of offerings and higher-­quality food will help win over ­Whataburger customers. It has launched a highway billboard campaign outside Dallas—where ­Whataburger has 20% of its stores—with the tag­line “No Microwaves, No Freezers, No Heat Lamps.”      On its California home turf, In-N-Out must defend against incursions. Shake Shack, the popular 359-million-in-sales burger chain founded by the New York restaurateur Danny Meyer, has come west, opening nine locations in southern California during the last two years, with plans to open three in the Bay Area starting this fall. Shake Shack burgers, made with meat from the famous high-end butcher Pat LaFrieda and served on potato-bread buns from Martin’s, have their own loyal following. “We wanted to bring our own spin to California,” says Andrew McCaughan, Shake Shack’s vice president of development. “It’s absolutely a key market for us, and we continue to really want to invest deeper and deeper in the market.”      At In-N-Out, Snyder’s “goals are not for us to be the biggest,” says executive vice president Bob Lang, a 45-year In-N-Out veteran. “Really, it’s about maintaining the legacy of her family and a family environment.”      Snyder is popular with her 26,000 employees. She has a 99% approval rating on Glassdoor.com, the job-reviews site, and is ranked No. 4. on a 2018 Glassdoor list of top bosses at large companies, ahead of CEOs like LinkedIn’s Jeff Weiner, Salesforce’s Marc Benioff and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella.      In-N-Out and Snyder get high marks for a reason: good pay and career development. Restaurant workers, or “associates” in In-N-Out speak, make 13 an hour, versus the 9 to 10 or so that’s typical at most national competitors, including McDonald’s and Burger King. Part- and full-time restaurant workers can enroll in dental, vision and life insurance plans through the company, and full-timers can get health insurance and paid vacation, accruing time off after two weeks of employment.      The average In-N-Out manager has been with the company for 17 years and makes 163,000, more than the typical California dentist, accountant or financial advisor. Managers get profit-sharing, too. “They’re simulating an ownership mentality at the restaurant,” says John Glass, a restaurant-industry equity analyst at Morgan Stanley. “That manager now has skin in the game.”      O      ne idea has been firmly held in the minds of the Snyders. It might as well be the family motto: The company isn’t for sale.      Back when he was chairman, Rich Snyder summed up the thought of selling In-N-Out this way: “I would be prostituting what my parents made by doing that,” he told Forbes in 1989. “There is money to be made by doing those things, but you lose something, and I don’t want to lose what I was raised with all my life.”      Over the course of a month, Lynsi Snyder routinely gets offers to take In-N-Out public or sell. “We’ve had some pretty crazy offers,” says Snyder. “There’s been, like, princes and different people throwing some big numbers at us where I’m like, ‘Really?’ ” The plan never changes. “We will continue to politely say no to Wall Street or to the Saudi princes. Whoever will come,” says Arnie Wensinger, In-N-Out’s longtime general counsel.      The idea of an In-N-Out IPO leaves bankers like Damon Chandik, the head of Piper Jaffray’s restaurant M&A team, salivating. “I get calls all the time on In-N-Out. It would be the hottest IPO out there,” he says. “I admire her and the whole company for not going down the path. You do have that risk of ultimately changing the culture of the business.”      Given the investor appetite for Shake Shack, whose stock trades at almost 100 times earnings, a public offering would undoubtedly hand In-N-Out tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in working capital—and give Snyder a way to cash out part of her stake in the business.      “It’s not about the money for us,” she says. “Unless God sends a lightning bolt down and changes my heart miraculously, I would not ever sell.”      Reach Chloe Sorvino at csorvino@forbes.com.

In a new interview with Forbes, the extremely private owner and president of In-N-Out, touches on losing her father to drug abuse, her own battle with addiction and her complicated love life.      While her father, Guy, headed up the West Coast burger chain for six years in the 1990s, he was arrested for public intoxication, suffered from a drug-related heart attack and three drug overdoses, according to Forbes. He was in an out of rehab since Snyder was 5 or 6 years old, but died of heart failure with hydrocodone in his system in 1999.      “When he was sober, he was the best dad in the world,” she says. “We had our time cut short.”      Soon after his death, Synder tells the magazine for their Forbes 400 cover story that she entered into “year-long stretch of alcohol and marijuana use.” At the time she married her high school sweetheart, Jeremiah Seawell, but the pair divorced after two years and she quickly entered into a doomed marriage with her second husband Richard Martinez.      “It was like a black-sheep era of my life,” she says. “By the time I hit 22, it was pretty much over.”      RELATED: Ina Garten Reveals the Only Fast Food She’ll Eat: ‘It Was Julia Child’s Favorite Too’      After going through two more divorces, Synder met her current husband, Sean Ellingson.

That might be why the movie The Martian (<<>> ) is so popular. It shows an astronaut struggling to live on Mars. But would it actually be possible to live on the Red Planet? While the idea of living on Mars is great, the reality does not look as good. Mars does not have a friendly atmosphere for humans. There is very little oxygen there. And because of its distance from the sun, it is also very cold. The temperature on Mars can be -62 degrees on average. This is much too cold for humans. However, scientists say it might be possible to live there even without a good atmosphere. Daytime on Mars is almost the same as Earth's. It means there's enough sunlight to grow plants inside safe buildings. However, they would have to grow in soil from Earth. Mars does not have a strong enough atmosphere to stop the radiation coming from space, which makes it dangerous to grow things in the soil. The radiation is also bad for our health. If we want to live there healthily, we need to build our homes under the ground or within the rocks on the planet. This would protect humans from the radiation and also some heat. When could we actually live on Mars? NASA is hoping to make some progress within the next 20 years.

What is the name of the actual bill that was the subject of the number of \\"Kill the Bill\\" demonstrations held by rave and electronic dance music fans?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In Britain, further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal. House and rave clubs such as Lakota and Cream emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in Britain with ambient house albums such as The KLF's Chill Out and Analogue Bubblebath by Aphex Twin. The Godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in Cambridge and Northampton, the associated events scaled up in Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Leeds. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In New York, bands such as Deee-Lite furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were the Orb's \\"Little Fluffy Clouds\\" (with a distinctive vocal sample from Rickie Lee Jones) and the Happy Mondays' \\"Wrote for Luck\\" (\\"WFL\\") which was transformed into a dance hit by Vince Clarke. The late Robert Miles also produced house tracks such as \\"One and One\\" with Maria Nayler, \\"Fable\\" and his biggest hit, \\"Children\\". In England, one of the few licensed venues was The Eclipse, which attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours. Due to the lack of licensed, legal dance event venues, house music promoters began organising illegal events in unused warehouses, aeroplane hangars and in the countryside. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with \\"repetitive beats\\", due to law enforcement allegations that these events were associated with illegal club drugs. There were a number of \\"Kill the Bill\\" demonstrations by rave and electronic dance music fans. The Spiral Tribe dance event at Castle Morten was the last of these illegal raves, as the bill, which became law, in November 1994, made unauthorised house music dance events illegal in the UK.

Question: \\"What are the things that are necessary for this process to function?\\"  Context: \\"The development of quadraphonic records was announced in 1971. These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround-sound systems, as seen in SACD and home cinema today.\\"  Answer:","output":"The things necessary for the quadraphonic record process to function are: 1. Quadraphonic records: An essential component, these records are designed to store four separate sound signals. The development of quadraphonic records allowed for a more immersive audio experience compared to traditional stereo records. 2. Electronic matrixing: This technique is crucial for combining the four separate sound signals into two stereo channels. It enables the encoding of additional audio channels into the main signal, allowing for compatibility with existing stereo playback systems. 3. Phase-detection circuits: These circuits are necessary for decoding the matrixed signals back into four separate channels when the records are played. They are present in the amplifiers and help in accurately extracting the different audio channels from the combined signal. 4. Compatible amplifiers: Amplifiers with phase-detection circuits are required for the process to function properly. They decode the matrixed signals and play them back through the corresponding speaker setup. 5. Four-channel speaker setup: A speaker system with four discrete channels is necessary to project the separated sound signals and create a surround sound experience. 6. SQ or QS systems: The process relies on one of these competing systems (SQ by CBS or QS by Sansui) for encoding and decoding the quadraphonic signals. Both systems have their unique approaches to matrixing and decoding, but they must be compatible with the records and playback equipment used. In summary, the necessary components for the quadraphonic record process to function include quadraphonic records, electronic matrixing, phase-detection circuits, compatible amplifiers, a four-channel speaker setup, and the use of either an SQ or QS system."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence, generate a most unlikely next statement.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","output":"No, the information provided does not directly answer the question about Coca-Cola's effects on nausea and vomiting. Instead, the answer provided is a generic description of Coca-Cola and its availability in countries worldwide. A more appropriate answer to the question would be: Coca-Cola, due to its carbonation and specific combination of ingredients, is believed to have some mild effects on relieving nausea and vomiting. The carbonation can help soothe an upset stomach, while the sugar content in the drink may provide calories and gentle stimulation for nauseous individuals who have difficulty consuming other foods. There is some anecdotal evidence that flat or slightly flat Coca-Cola may be more effective for this purpose because it is less carbonated and would be less likely to cause excess gas and bloating. However, it is important to note that consuming Coca-Cola is not a universally accepted or clinically proven remedy for nausea and vomiting. Individuals who experience severe and persistent symptoms should consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, consuming excessive amounts of sugar and caffeine, as present in Coca-Cola, may not be suitable for people with certain health conditions or dietary restrictions.

To take advantage of Ava's dynastic succession crisis, Razadarit invaded Upper Burma in full force with a large flotilla in 1401. Ava's defenses held, and Razadarit and Minkhaung I of Ava agreed to another truce in 1403. The second truce lasted less than 5 years as Ava quickly went on an expansion spree, swallowing up Shan states of Kale and Mohnyin in the north, and Arakan in the west, between 1404 and 1406. Pegu could not allow Ava to get too strong, and renewed the war. In 1408, Peguan forces dislodged Avan troops from Arakan. Pegu also found an ally in the Shan state of Theinni , which too wanted to check Ava's ambitions. Between 1408 and 1413, Ava was forced to fight on multiple fronts: Theinni in the north, and Pegu in the south and in the west . Nonetheless, by 1412, Avan forces, led by Crown Prince Minye Kyawswa, had begun to gain an upper hand. Minye Kyawswa defeated Theinni and its Chinese allies in 1412.

Q:Given the background: Shad are also valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding behavior while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered by a variety of factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Anglers use both spinning and fly fishing tackle to pursue shad. Spin fisherman use a shad dartjig or a flutter spoon. Some anglers use a downrigger to place the artificial lure at the desired depth and location. This is usually in the channel, or deepest part of the river. Migrating shad tend to occupy the lower portion of the water column which makes this the typical depth of choice for fishing. In the North, April through June is when shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries once water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions typically improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases.  and the situation: Jeff loves to go shad fishing. He prefers using fly fishing tackle and is planning a fishing trip up North with his buddies. They decided to take their trip in May when everyone can get off work over the Memorial Day holiday. Sam enjoys shad fishing as well, but the only time he and his buddies are able to take off work is during their slow season in March.  Answer the following question: Who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam? A:","output":"Sam will likely have worse fishing conditions and catch less shad on their fishing trip compared to Jeff. This is because Sam and his buddies are planning their trip in March, which is earlier in the year than the optimal shad spawning season. The ideal time for shad fishing in the North is from April through June, when water temperatures reach 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C) and the shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries. Fishing conditions improve as water temperatures warm and water flow decreases. In contrast, Jeff and his buddies plan their trip in May, during the Memorial Day holiday, which falls within the typical shad spawning season. As a result, they can expect better fishing conditions and a higher likelihood of catching shad compared to Sam's trip in March."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The New York Times But the trade deal is one small piece of a tangled relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan that the United States is struggling to manage. American officials have long accused Pakistan of providing clandestine support to the militants who attack American-led forces in Afghanistan even as the Pakistanis say they support the American war there. And while American leaders have encouraged warming ties between Afghanistan and Pakistan, they also fear that Pakistani officials want to exert too much control over Afghan politics. The success of the deal is far from assured. Pakistan’s prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, alluded to potential domestic fallout at a meeting with Mrs. Clinton, who arrived under heavy security on Sunday. “There are people, there are lobbies who don’t want this,” he said, noting that the deal’s opponents were agitating in the news media. But he added, “It is in the interest of Pakistan to have a stable Afghanistan.” A critical provision of the deal would allow Afghan trucks to carry goods to Pakistani ports like Karachi or as far as Indian border posts, while Pakistani trucks could travel into Afghanistan. Under current law, goods must be reloaded at the border. The accord cast a positive glow over Mrs. Clinton’s visit, which is meant to ease suspicions between Pakistan and the United States. She came with a number of initiatives in public health, water distribution and agriculture, to be financed by 500 million in American economic aid. Among other projects, the United States will build a 60-bed hospital in Karachi and help farmers export mangos. These projects, however beneficial in this economically fragile country, do not dispel other nagging sources of friction between the two sides. In addition to American doubts about Pakistan’s commitment to root out Taliban insurgents, there are new fears about Pakistan’s nuclear program. Pakistan plans to buy two nuclear reactors from China, a deal that alarms the United States because it is cloaked in secrecy and is being conducted outside the global nonproliferation regime. Administration officials said Mrs. Clinton was expected to raise the issue with the Pakistanis. Relations could be further tested if the Obama administration decides to place leaders of a major Pakistani insurgent group, the Haqqani network, on the State Department’s terrorist list. Islamabad maintains ties to the group through its intelligence service, and it is seeking to exploit those connections to extend its influence over Afghanistan. For all that, tensions between the two sides have ebbed since Mrs. Clinton’s last visit here in October, when she was peppered with hostile questions in public meetings and bluntly suggested that people in the Pakistani government knew the whereabouts of Al Qaeda’s leaders. Mr. Holbrooke noted a U-turn in Pakistan’s policy on issuing visas to American diplomats. For months, Pakistani officials had held up those applications, creating a huge backlog and frustrating the United States. But Pakistan issued 450 visas in the last five days, he said. He conceded that public opinion polls here about the United States had yet to show much of a change. Conspiracy theories involving the United States are widely popular, with large numbers of Pakistanis blaming the United States for anything that goes wrong here. Some analysts here said that the United States had failed to communicate its support adequately through the local news media. Mrs. Clinton may take more hits on Monday at a town hall meeting here. Still, American officials were emphasizing convergence between the United States and Pakistan. While the Americans would like to see a more aggressive Pakistani military push in North Waziristan, the stronghold of the Haqqani network, they praised the military’s campaigns in South Waziristan and the Swat Valley, where Taliban insurgents had also made gains. Pakistan’s battle has exacted a fearful toll. This month a suicide bomber killed 45 people in an attack on a Sufi shrine in Lahore. Many Pakistanis blame the war in Afghanistan for fomenting anti-Pakistan terrorism. Protest groups issued a statement, timed to Mrs. Clinton’s arrival, that called for an end to the war and for Americans and Pakistanis who are involved in clandestine air strikes on Pakistani targets to be tried for war crimes. Mrs. Clinton’s initiatives are the first major disbursements of 7.5 billion in nonmilitary aid, over five years, pledged by Congress last year. The emphasis is on basic services like electricity and water, politically charged issues in this country, particularly during the hot summer. “Our commitment is broad and deep,” said Rajiv Shah, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, who is with Mrs. Clinton. “We will not do what we’ve done in the past.” Administration officials said the project to upgrade Pakistan’s creaky power grid, which involves building dams and refurbishing power plants, had helped reduce chronic power failures. But on the day Mrs. Clinton landed, television reports here warned of further blackouts.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  I am facing a new situation today: Vince had a small rural farm. He needed to increase production and efficiency, so he started using herbicides. Danny was one of his farmer friends, he had a small acreage farm and he practiced permaculture, so no pesticides.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which farmer planted fewer crops tolerant to herbicide? The answer is:","output":"Danny planted fewer crops tolerant to herbicide. Step 1: Identify the practices of each farmer - Vince is using herbicides to increase production and efficiency. - Danny practices permaculture and does not use pesticides. Step 2: Relate the farmers' practices to herbicide tolerance - Vince, who uses herbicides, is more likely to plant crops that are tolerant to herbicides. This would help him maximize the benefits of using herbicides without harming his crops. - Danny, on the other hand, does not use pesticides. Since he practices permaculture, it is likely that he values natural methods of pest and weed control. Therefore, he would have less need for herbicide-tolerant crops. Step 3: Compare the two farmers - Given their respective farming methods, Danny would have planted fewer herbicide-tolerant crops than Vince."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Adam Craig Gilchrist, AM (; born 14 November 1971), nicknamed \\"Gilly\\" or \\"Churchy\\", is a former Australian international cricketer and former captain of all formats. Widely regarded as the greatest wicket-keeper-batsman in the history of the game, Gilchrist held the world record for the most dismissals by a wicket-keeper in One Day International (ODI) cricket until it was surpassed by Kumar Sangakkara in 2015 and the most by an Australian in Test cricket. He was captain of Middlesex in the domestic arena. Gilchrist was selected for the state under-17 team, and in 1989 he was offered a scholarship by London-based Richmond Cricket Club, a scheme he now supports himself. Cricket has for many years debated whether batsmen should \\"walk\\", that is to agree that they have been dismissed and leave the field of play without waiting for (or contrary to) an umpire's decision. Gilchrist reignited this debate by walking during a high-profile match, the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka, after the umpire ruled him to be not out. He has since proclaimed himself to be \\"a walker\\", or a batsman who will consistently walk, and has done so on numerous occasions. On one occasion against Bangladesh, Gilchrist walked but TV replays failed to suggest any contact between his bat and the ball. Without such contact, he could not have been caught out.  Gilchrist's actions have sparked debate amongst current and former players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has declared on several occasions that he is not a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a \\"walking crusade\\" when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: \\"...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...\\". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had \\"zero support in the team\\" for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he \\"felt isolated\\" and \\"silently accused of betraying the team. Implicitly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest.\\"  Gilchrist has been noted for his emotional outbursts on the cricket field, and has been fined multiple times for dissent against umpiring decisions. In January 2006, he was fined 40% of his match fee in an ODI against South Africa. In another instance, in early 2004 in Sri Lanka, Gilchrist audibly argued with umpire Peter Manuel after batting partner Andrew Symonds was given out. After the argument concluded, Manuel consulted umpiring partner Billy Bowden and reversed his decision, recalling Symonds to the crease. Gilchrist was also reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board for publicly questioning the legality of Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling action in 2002, as his comments were found to be in breach of the clause in the player code of conduct relating to \\"detrimental public comment\\".  During the 2003 World Cup, Gilchrist accused Pakistani wicketkeeper Rashid Latif of making a racist remark towards him while the latter was batting in their group match. Latif who was cleared by match referee Clive Lloyd, threatened to sue Gilchrist for this claim. What happened in the 2003 world cup match?","output":"In the 2003 World Cup semi-final match, a significant incident occurred involving Adam Gilchrist, who is widely regarded as the greatest wicket-keeper-batsman in the history of the game. Gilchrist, hailing from Australia, reignited the cricket debate on whether batsmen should \\"walk\\" - agree they've been dismissed and leave the field of play without waiting for, or even contrary to, an umpire's decision. In this match against Sri Lanka, the umpire ruled Gilchrist to be not out. However, contradicting the umpire's decision, Gilchrist chose to walk off the field, proclaiming himself to be \\"a walker,\\" a batsman who will consistently agree to their dismissal and depart the field. He has upheld this stance on numerous occasions. His decision in the 2003 World Cup semi-final sparked further debate among current and former players as well as umpires, and has been a significant point of reference in discussions around the \\"walking\\" protocol in the game of cricket. Notably, his actions during this match have been recognized as parts of a perceived broader \\"walking crusade.\\" However, this stance was not universally accepted or applauded. For instance, Australian cricketer, Ricky Ponting, declared he was not a \\"walker\\" but believed each player should decide for themselves whether to walk or not. Gilchrist's decision to walk has even been met with strong opposition, as seen in the case of New Zealand's Stephen Fleming accusing him of conducting a \\"walking crusade.\\"  In this same 2003 World Cup, another incident occurred involving Gilchrist. He accused Pakistani wicketkeeper Rashid Latif of making racist remarks towards him while Latif was batting in their group match. Latif, who was cleared by match referee Clive Lloyd, threatened to sue Gilchrist for making this claim. In summation, the 2003 World Cup semi-final match involving Australia and Sri Lanka was a defining moment in the career of Adam Gilchrist, particularly in his advocacy for the \\"walking\\" protocol. His actions in this match ignited widespread debate in the cricket world and raised complex questions about sportsmanship, individual beliefs, and the unwritten rules of cricket."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: I don’t see a point. That’s the biggest problem with my life currently. I honestly, don’t see a point. Am I working towards temporary monetary gain? Is my goal supposed to be buying my dream car(s)? Is my goal spiritual? I’m currently Catholic, but I’ve seen how spiritually those around me have changed. I’ve even wondered what’s the point of heaven, if everything I want is there. I like life because of the ups and the downs. I enjoy learning and discovering new things. The idea of perfection seems like an impossible concept to me. Maybe even an unenjoyable one. Maybe my goal is to have a family. Being catholic naturally we gravitate towards larger families. But as a libertarian I don’t see a lot of potential in the United States at it pertains to economic freedoms. I see the government encroaching more and more into our lives. Is this the type of country I want to raise a family in? I certainly don’t want to be outside the United States (no offense towards anyone outside of the U.S). Maybe my goal is political. I’ve always wanted to run for office. Maybe governor one day. Would I be able to avoid the waves of bipartisanship, and actually do what I believe is the best for the people of my state. Or would I collapse under the political pressures and sign up for agreements I know in my heart and mind won’t help the people. Only time will tell. I just don’t see a point. I actually have many goals, but I struggle to see the overall point of accomplishing any of it. Especially seeing as anything I do will be lost in the ink-blots of history.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  A few weeks after Of Human Feelings was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with Trio Records to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who wants someone dead to punish someone else? , can you please find it?   Warlock is a small Utah mining town of the early 1880s. Cowboys working for Abe McQuown often come into town to shoot the place up, kill on just a whim, beating or humiliating any sheriff who tries to stand up to them. The Citizens' Committee decides to hire Clay Blaisedell, a renowned gunfighter, as town marshal in spite of the misgivings of some, such as old Judge Holloway who insists that the situation should be handled within the law (though a loophole prevents it from being done effectively). Blaisedell, famous for his golden-handled revolvers, arrives in Warlock with his devoted friend, Tom Morgan, his club-footed, right-hand man, who is no slouch with a gun himself. Morgan has a reputation as a heavy-drinking gambler, but Blaisedell insists that Morgan is part of the package. They even take over the local saloon and rename it the \\"French Palace\\" (something they appear to have done in previous towns, since they bring the signboard with them). Their first encounter with McQuown's men is without bloodshed. The cowboys are intimidated by Blaisedell and one, Johnny Gannon, stays behind. Gannon has been put off by their propensity for killing, particularly the shooting of victims in the back, for some time now and resolves to be more law-abiding. Morgan learns that his old flame, Lily Dollar, is coming to town on the stagecoach, and she is accompanied by Bob Nicholson, brother of Big Ben Nicholson, who was recently killed by Blaisedell. Lily had left Morgan for Big Ben and knows that Morgan pushed Ben into challenging Blaisedell, who killed him as a result. She wants Blaisedell dead to punish Morgan. Morgan sets out to meet the stagecoach but it is robbed by some of McQuown's cowboys as he watches from a distance. He takes advantage of the situation to kill Bob Nicholson unseen. Lily arrives in town and sees Morgan there. She believes that he pulled the trigger, although this is based on intuition rather than evidence.

Write some highlights for the following article: The Spanish League will decide Tuesday afternoon if they are going to take action against Barcelona supporters singing ‘Ronaldo is a drunk’ at the Camp Nou on Sunday night. The League have officials at every La Liga match and the one at Barcelona’s meeting with Levante at the weekend included hearing the song in their report. If the Spanish League reports it to the Antiviolence Committee Barcelona could be fined or even have a part of the Nou Camp closed. The steps being considered are a result of Spanish football’s intention of cutting out all forms of crowd trouble or incitement to crowd trouble since a Deportivo supporter was killed in a pitched battle before a match at Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon stadium in November. Barcelona fans chanted 'Ronaldo is a drunk' about Real Madrid star Cristiano at the Nou Camp. Barcelona could now face disciplinary action from the Spanish league. Pictured is their star man Lionel Messi. Despite what some might term 'terrace banter' appearing to have little to do with the organised violence that ended with a supporter being beaten to death outside a stadium last year, the football authorities have included chants and songs in their crackdown on trouble. Barca fan taunts followed Ronaldo’s 30th birthday party when he was videoed and photographed celebrating after a 4-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid. The league threatened similar action for sections of the Bernabeu chanting ‘Messi is retarded’ in December but none was taken. Real Madrid, however, were reported to have identified the 17 supporters who started the chant and expelled them. Ronaldo (right) sings alongside Colombian singer Kevin Roldan at his 30th birthday party. James Rodriguez, Roldan and  Ronaldo celebrates the Portuguese's 30th birthday earlier this month. In the past abuse of a racist nature aimed at players has gone unpunished in Spain with Dani Alves, Samuel Eto’o and Ashley Cole on international duty for England at the Bernabeu in 2004 all victims. The apparently frivolous nature of the song aimed at Ronaldo mean any serious punishment is likely to be met with ridicule outside of Spain. But with the Real Madrid v Barcelona rivalry colouring all La Liga debate there will be no shortage of Real Madrid supporters keen for the League to carry through on its threat.","output":"In a soccer game, some Barcelona fans sang a mean song about a player from another team named Ronaldo, calling him a \\"drunk\\".

Possible answers: buy a home theater and watch documentals, go on vacation, work overtime at her current job A:","output":"Given the context, Sydney is focused on raising extra money and is in need of cash. Therefore, the most likely option Sydney would want to do next is to work overtime at her current job. This is because working overtime can provide her with an opportunity to earn more money, thus addressing her immediate need for cash. Buying a home theater and watching documentaries is not a suitable choice in this context, as it would require Sydney to spend money rather than raise it. Moreover, watching documentaries might be a recreational activity but would not help her financially in the short term. Similarly, going on vacation is an unlikely choice for Sydney since it also involves spending money instead of raising the funds she needs. Vacations can be costly, including expenses such as flights, accommodations, meals, and other activities. Choosing this option would not only keep her from meeting her financial goals but may also potentially put her in a more challenging financial situation. In conclusion, given the context of Sydney's need for extra cash, it is most reasonable to assume that she would want to work overtime at her current job.

The answer is:","output":"The missing first step in this process is the weathering and erosion of rocks. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Weathering and erosion of rocks: The process begins with the breakdown of parent rocks into smaller fragments through processes like freeze-thaw cycles, wind, water, and other natural forces. This step is essential because it is the starting point for the subsequent formation of sedimentary rocks. 2. Wind or water deposits tiny rocks: Once the rocks have been weathered and eroded into smaller pieces, they can be transported and deposited by wind or water in various locations. 3. The rocks become known as sediment: After the tiny rocks have been deposited, they start to accumulate and become known as sediment. 4. The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top: Over time, additional layers of sediment are deposited on top of the existing layers, applying pressure and compacting the lower layers. 5. Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve: As the pressure increases, the minerals within the rocks begin to dissolve, enabling a chemical reaction to take place. 6. Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock: As the dissolved minerals from the sediment react, they act as a natural cement to bind the individual sediment particles together, forming a cohesive, solid rock known as a sedimentary rock."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: More than 15 million Britons, many of them women, will holiday unaccompanied this year. And they will no longer be treated as second-class citizens. After 50 years of being slighted, ripped off, herded together and allocated the worst rooms in the hotel, the single traveller's time has finally come. Rather than being viewed as an awkward peculiarity in the standard couples-and-families \\"system\\", single travelers have become travel's fastest growing sector and a phenomenon that tour operators are falling over themselves to catch up with. In one sense, the boom is the result of people postponing marriage and children. Approximately 39% of the adult British population--19 million people--is now single and the proportion of one-person households has increased from 18% in 1971 to 29% last year. The most significant growth of singles over the next few years is expected to be within the well-off, travel-hungry 25-34 age group.  The expansion in single travel is being increased by women. Women are just as happy as men to leave partner at home and head off on holiday. On adventure group trips single women constitute more than half of all travelers, and Internet agents report that 70% of their single clients are women.     Women today see being single as an opportunity to travel, rather than as an obstacle. The result is that travel companies are now attempting to work out new ways of attracting singles----a market worth PS10.4 billion. The number of specialist singles tour operators has risen from a couple to at least 10, but they face a growing challenge from mainstream operators, who now propose to target solo travelers with moves like abolishing single room supplements. At the moment, single travelers usually have to join a group, or pay more. As soon as we get beyond that, the singles market is going to take off to a completely new level. Travel companies are reacting to changing trends by   _  . A) trying to find travel partners for singles B) charging more for one-person room occupancy C) encouraging solo travelers to join groups D) specializing in singles holiday requirements A:","output":"D) Specializing in singles holiday requirements The boom in single travelers, driven by factors such as shifting lifestyles, postponing marriage and children, and an increase in solo female travelers, has led to the rise of a lucrative market worth £10.4 billion. Recognizing the potential in catering to the needs and preferences of single travelers, travel companies are now rethinking their strategies and exploring new ways to attract this growing demographic. Historically, single travelers have often been treated as second-class citizens — given less desirable accommodations and charged extra for occupying a room by themselves. However, with the rapidly expanding market for solo travel, the industry has begun to acknowledge the importance of accommodating single travelers better and the opportunities to be gained by doing so. One approach to tap into this market is by specializing in singles holiday requirements, which can involve customizing packages and experiences specifically for solo travelers. This can include offering a wider range of activities or events tailored to individual interests, ensuring safety and comfort for solo travelers, and providing opportunities for singles to socialize and meet like-minded individuals. As a response to the growing number of single travelers, specialist singles tour operators have increased from just a few to at least ten. These operators solely focus on offering trips and experiences specifically designed for single travelers, differentiating themselves from mainstream tour operators, who typically cater to couples and families. Moreover, mainstream operators are also recognizing the potential to capture a share of the single travel market and are adapting their strategies. One such move is the proposal to abolish single room supplements, which have long remained an obstacle for single travelers in terms of cost and accessibility. In conclusion, the answer is D) specializing in singles holiday requirements, as travel companies are actively responding to the changing trends in the market by tailoring their services to better accommodate single travelers and capture a significant share of the growing and lucrative solo travel sector."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar.

Q:Information:  - A steam locomotive is a railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible materialusually coal/coke, wood, or oilto produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind. The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first operated on 21 February 1804, three years after the road locomotive he made in 1801. The first practical steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop.  - The Milwaukee Road 's class F7 comprised six ( # 100 -- # 105 ) high - speed , streamlined 4 - 6 - 4 \`\` Baltic '' or \`\` Hudson '' type steam locomotives built by Alco in 1937 -- 38 to haul the Milwaukee 's Hiawatha express passenger trains . Following on from the success of the road 's class A 4 - 4 - 2s , the F7s allowed the road to haul heavier trains on the popular Chicago -- Twin Cities routes . The F7s are major contenders for the fastest steam locomotives ever built , as they ran at over 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) daily . One run in January 1941 recorded by a reporter for Trains magazine saw 110 miles per hour ( 180 km / h ) achieved twice -- in the midst of a heavy snowstorm . Baron Gérard Vuillet , a French railroading expert , once recorded a run between Chicago and Milwaukee where the locomotive reached 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) and sustained an average 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) for 4.5 miles ( 7.2 km ) . However , the British locomotive LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard is officially accepted to be the world 's fastest , with a run recorded at 125.88 mph ( 202.58 km / h ) in 1938 . The Milwaukee F7s are accepted as the fastest steam locomotives by a different measure -- scheduled speed between stations . In 1939 , shortly after they were introduced into passenger service , the Twin Cities Hiawatha schedule was modified such that the engines would need to run the 78.3 mi ( 126.0 km ) between Portage and Sparta , Wisconsin in 58 minutes -- a start - to - stop average of 81 mph ( 130 km / h ) . First - built # 100 was also the first withdrawn from service , on November 10 , 1949 ; last - built # 105 was the final one in service , withdrawn August 10 , 1951 . All were scrapped .  - On a steam locomotive, a driving wheel is a powered wheel which is driven by the locomotive's pistons (or turbine, in the case of a steam turbine locomotive). On a conventional, non-articulated locomotive, the driving wheels are all coupled together with side rods (also known as coupling rods); normally one pair is directly driven by the main rod (or connecting rod) which is connected to the end of the piston rod; power is transmitted to the others through the side rods.  - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels, six powered and coupled driving wheels and four trailing wheels. In France, where the type was first used, it is known as the Baltic, while it became known as the Hudson in most of North America.    What entity does 'milwaukee road class f7' has the relation 'powerplant' with? A:","output":"The entity that Milwaukee Road Class F7 has the relation 'powerplant' with is a steam engine, as these locomotives produced their pulling power through steam engines.

Athens' local music is based primarily in the small downtown area of the northern part of the town. The nightclub 40 Watt Club is among the most famous indie rock venues on the East Coast; the club opened on Halloween in 1978, with a band called Strictly American featuring Curtis Crowe, founder of the club and future member of the band Pylon. Other major music venues in the city include the Georgia Theater, (a converted cinema that hosted both local and touring performers. The Theater burned down in June 2009, but has been fully remodelled into a state of the art music venue reopening in early August 2011), the Caledonia Lounge, the historic Foundry Music Venue (which was originally built in 1850 as an iron foundry), and the UGA Performing Arts Center, home to the Ramsey Concert Hall and the Hugh Hodgson Concert Hall. The Morton Theater is a historic venue, a major part of the city's African American community in the early 20th century; it claims to be the only theater from that era remaining in operation.Athens is home to the summer music festival Athfest,  AlanFest, the Athens Popfest and the late spring Athens Human Rights Festival and North Georgia Folk Festival. The college radio station WUOG (90.5 FM), the low-power (100.7) FM WPPP-LP and the free weekly Flagpole are the city's most prominent modern music media.

Question: suppose there is less plant acid in the soil happens, how will it affect less virus copies made.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"No effect. Justification:  1. First, I understand the process of how a virus replicates once it has entered a host body. This process is primarily internal within the host and is not directly affected by external factors such as the soil acidity. 2. The change mentioned, i.e., less plant acid in the soil, is an external environmental change. It is known that soil acidity can impact the growth and health of plants. However, this change does not directly impact the replication process of a virus within a host body.  3. It's crucial to understand that the replication of a virus depends on its interaction with host cells, not the external environment where the host may live. 4. Therefore, I concluded 'no effect' as the soil's plant acid level would not directly affect the number of virus copies made within a host.  Changes in soil acidity could potentially affect the overall health of a host organism if it's a plant but if the host is an animal or human, such changes pose no direct impact on the virus replication process. Hence, the supposed perturbation (less plant acid in the soil) would have no effect on the second effect mentioned (less virus copies made)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: Before printing was widely adopted in the 19th century, the Quran was transmitted in manuscripts made by calligraphers and copyists. The earliest manuscripts were written in Ḥijāzī-type script. The Hijazi style manuscripts nevertheless confirm that transmission of the Quran in writing began at an early stage. Probably in the ninth century, scripts began to feature thicker strokes, which are traditionally known as Kufic scripts. Toward the end of the ninth century, new scripts began to appear in copies of the Quran and replace earlier scripts. The reason for discontinuation in the use of the earlier style was that it took too long to produce and the demand for copies was increasing. Copyists would therefore chose simpler writing styles.

Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft).  Paragraph: Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S).

The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while..., what would be the answer ?

Question: Question: \\"In what way are the aids different from bread?\\"  Context: \\"Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers. The use of counting rods is one example.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The aids mentioned in the context and bread are fundamentally different in their purpose, composition, and historical significance. To better understand the differences, let us examine each aspect individually. 1. Purpose: The primary difference between the aids and bread lies in their intended use. Aids, such as counting devices or record-keeping tools, have been developed to assist humans in computing, counting, and storing information. These aids facilitate accurate and efficient handling of various mathematical and informational tasks. For instance, tally sticks, counting rods, and calculi were designed to help people keep track of numbers and perform calculations. On the other hand, bread serves a completely different purpose. Bread is a staple food made from flour and water, typically through a process of mixing, kneading, fermentation, and baking. It is primarily consumed to provide nourishment and satiate hunger. It has been a vital part of human diets across different cultures and throughout history, acting as a fundamental source of sustenance and energy. 2. Composition: Another significant difference lies in their material composition. Aids and counting devices are generally made from non-edible materials such as wood (tally sticks), clay (calculi), and even metal or stone. These materials allow the devices to be durable, reusable, and suitable for their intended use in record-keeping processes. Bread, however, is composed of edible ingredients including flour (usually from wheat, although other grains can be used), water, and often additional components like salt, yeast, and various flavorings. These ingredients undergo chemical and physical transformations during the bread-making process, resulting in a consumable product that can be ingested by humans or animals. 3. Historical Significance: Both the aids and bread hold significant historical importance but in distinct ways. The development and use of aids in computation demonstrate the evolution of human thought, mathematical understanding, and technological advancements. These tools played a crucial role in the progress of early civilizations by aiding trade, agriculture, and administration, and they laid the groundwork for more sophisticated technologies and systems, such as the abacus and modern computing devices. Bread, on the other hand, reflects the development of agriculture, culinary practices, cultural traditions, and human survival. The cultivation of wheat and the production of bread parallel the growth of agriculture and the formation of early civilizations. Bread has been a uniting factor across cultures as a shared food staple, and its varieties and methods of preparation represent the diversity and richness of human culinary traditions. In conclusion, aids and bread differ greatly in their purpose, composition, and historical significance. Aids are designed for computation and record-keeping, while bread serves as a food source for nourishment. Aids are made from non-edible materials, whereas bread is composed of edible ingredients. Finally, the historical importance of aids lies in their contribution to human thought and technology, while bread carries significance in terms of agriculture, culinary arts, and cultural traditions."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients.

Charles V (Spanish: Carlos; German: Karl; Italian: Carlo; Latin: Carolus; Dutch: Karel; French: Charles,  24 February 1500 - 21 September 1558) was ruler of both the Spanish Empire as Charles I from 1516 and the Holy Roman Empire as Charles V from 1519, as well as of the lands of the former Duchy of Burgundy from 1506. He stepped down from these and other positions by a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Through inheritance, he brought together under his rule extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas and Asia. Charles fought continually with the Ottoman Empire and its sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent. The defeat of Hungary at the Battle of Mohacs in 1526 \\"sent a wave of terror over Europe.\\" The Muslim advance in Central Europe was halted at the Siege of Vienna in 1529.  Suleiman won the contest for mastery of the Mediterranean, in spite of Spanish victories such as the conquest of Tunis in 1535. The regular Ottoman fleet came to dominate the Eastern Mediterranean after its victories at Preveza in 1538 and Djerba in 1560 (shortly after Charles's death), which severely decimated the Spanish marine arm. At the same time, the Muslim Barbary corsairs, acting under the general authority and supervision of the sultan, regularly devastated the Spanish and Italian coasts, crippling Spanish trade and chipping at the foundations of Habsburg power.  In 1536 Francis I of France allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. While Francis was persuaded to sign a peace treaty in 1538, he again allied himself with the Ottomans in 1542 in a Franco-Ottoman alliance. In 1543 Charles allied himself with Henry VIII and forced Francis to sign the Truce of Crepy-en-Laonnois. Later, in 1547, Charles signed a humiliating treaty with the Ottomans to gain himself some respite from the huge expenses of their war.  Charles V made overtures to the Safavid Empire to open a second front against the Ottomans, in an attempt at creating a Habsburg-Persian alliance. Contacts were positive, but rendered difficult by enormous distances. In effect, however, the Safavids did enter in conflict with the Ottoman Empire in the Ottoman-Safavid War, forcing it to split its military resources. Why did it send a wave of terror over Europe?","output":"When the Battle of Mohacs happened in 1526, it sent a wave of terror over Europe because it showed that the Ottoman Empire, led by Suleiman the Magnificent, was very powerful. The Ottoman Empire was a Muslim empire, and many people in Europe were Christian.

According to Douglas Cooper: \\"The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso's impressive Woman's Head, modeled in 1909–10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time.\\" These positive/negative reversals were ambitiously exploited by Alexander Archipenko in 1912–13, for example in Woman Walking. Joseph Csaky, after Archipenko, was the first sculptor in Paris to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onwards. They were followed by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and then in 1914 by Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Laurens and Ossip Zadkine. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Alexander Archipenko paint in 1915?","output":"Alright kiddo, let me tell you about Alexander Archipenko. He was an artist who made cool sculptures and paintings. In 1915, I don't know exactly what he painted, but I can tell you that during that time, he was making things that looked like they were made of blocks and shapes. This was called Cubism, and many artists like him were doing it too. It was a new and fun way to make art.

(Associated Press)      U.S. astronaut Nick Hague, member of the main crew to the International Space Station (ISS), waves to his sons from a bus prior to the launch of Soyuz-FG rocket at the Russian leased Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, Thursday, Oct. 11, 2018. (AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky, Pool) (Associated Press)      BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan (AP) — The problem came two minutes into the flight: The rocket carrying an American and a Russian to the International Space Station failed Thursday, triggering an emergency that sent their capsule into a steep, harrowing fall back to Earth.      The crew landed safely on the steppes of Kazakhstan, but the aborted mission dealt another blow to the troubled Russian space program that currently serves as the only link to deliver astronauts to the orbiting outpost.      NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos' Alexei Ovchinin had a brief period of weightlessness when the capsule separated from the malfunctioning Soyuz rocket at an altitude of about 50 kilometers (31 miles), then endured gravitational forces of 6-7 times more than is felt on Earth as they came down at a sharper-than-normal angle.      About a half-hour later, the capsule parachuted onto a barren area about 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the city of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan.      \\"Thank God the crew is alive,\\" said Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin. He added that Putin received regular updates.      New NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, who watched the launch at the Russian-leased Baikonur cosmodrome along with his Russian counterpart, said Hague and Ovchinin were in good condition. He added that a \\"thorough investigation into the cause of the incident will be conducted.\\"      All Russian manned launches will be suspended pending an investigation into the cause of the failure, said Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov.      Hague, 43, and Ovchinin, 47, lifted off as scheduled at 2:40 p.m. (0840 GMT; 4:40 a.m. EDT) from Baikonur. The astronauts were to dock at the space station six hours after the launch and join an American, a Russian and a German on board.      But the three-stage Soyuz booster suffered an unspecified failure of its second stage two minutes after launch. Russian news reports indicated that one of its four first-stage engines might have failed to jettison in sync with others, resulting in the second stage's shutdown and activating the automatic emergency rescue system.      Search and rescue teams were immediately scrambled to recover the crew, and paratroopers were dropped from a plane to reach the site quickly. Dzhezkazgan is about 450 kilometers (280 miles) northeast of Baikonur, and spacecraft returning from the space station normally land in that region.      The astronauts were flown by helicopter to Dzhezkazgan, where they underwent a medical checkup and then taken by plane to Baikonur for more checks and to see their families. They will spend the night in Baikonur before being flown to Star City, Russia's space training center outside Moscow.      It was to be the first space mission for Hague, who joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2013. Ovchinin spent six months on the orbiting outpost in 2016.      Oleg Orlov, the head of Russia's main space medicine center, said the higher-than-usual gravity load posed no threat to the astronauts, who have been trained to endure high g-forces.      During the launch, astronauts wear spacesuits and are tightly strapped into their customs-made seats helping withstand the G-forces.      Flight controllers kept the three space station residents abreast of the situation after Thursday's aborted launch.      \\"The boys have landed,\\" Mission Control assured the space station crew.      \\"Glad our friends are fine,\\" space station commander Alexander Gerst, a European Space Agency astronaut from Germany, tweeted from orbit. \\"Spaceflight is hard. And we must keep trying for the benefit of humankind.\\"      There was no immediate word on whether the space station crew might need to extend its own six-month mission. Two spacewalks planned for later this month were off indefinitely. Hague was supposed to be one of the spacewalkers.      NASA said it's dusting off its plans for operating the space station without a crew, just in case the Russian investigation drags into next year.      Kenny Todd, a space station manager, said from Houston that the three-member space station crew can stay on board until January. That's just a month beyond their expected mid-December return. Their Soyuz capsule is good for about 200 days in orbit.      If the Soyuz rocket remains grounded until it's time for the astronauts to come home, flight controllers could operate the orbiting lab without anyone on board, Todd said.      The space station could operate like that indefinitely, barring a major equipment failure, he added. But it will need to be staffed before SpaceX or Boeing launches its new crew capsules next year, Todd said. Given that the space station is a 100 billion asset, Todd says it needs to have someone on board for the arrival of the commercial demo missions, for safety reasons.      While the Russian space program has been dogged by a string of launch failures and other mishaps in recent years, Thursday's incident marked the program's first manned launch failure since September 1983, when a Soyuz exploded on the launch pad.      Borisov said Russia will fully share all relevant information with the U.S., which pays up to 82 million per ride to the space station.      \\"I hope that the American side will treat it with understanding,\\" he said. \\"We will naturally provide them with all the necessary information about what caused the failure.\\"      Earlier this week, NASA's Bridenstine emphasized that collaboration with Russia's Roscosmos remains important.      Relations between Moscow and Washington have sunk to post-Cold War lows over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential vote, but they have maintained cooperation in space research.      The Russian Soyuz spacecraft is currently the only vehicle for ferrying crews to the space station following the retirement of the U.S. space shuttle fleet. Russia stands to lose that monopoly in the coming years with the arrival of SpaceX's Dragon and Boeing's Starliner crew capsules.      The last time the Russian space program had a manned launch failure was in 1983. Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launch pad after the Soyuz explosion.      \\"It's an unpleasant situation,\\" Titov told the Tass news agency Thursday. \\"We went through it, and it was very bad.\\"      He added that it will take about a week for the crew to fully recover.      In 1975, the failure of a Soyuz upper stage sent Vasily Lazarev and Oleg Makarov into a fiery fall to Earth from an altitude of 190 kilometers, subjecting them to enormous gravity loads that caused them to black out and temporarily lose eyesight. They landed on a snowy mountain slope and spent two nights shivering in the cold before rescue crews reached them.      Russia has continued to rely on Soviet-designed booster rockets for commercial satellites, as well as crews and cargo to the space station.      While Russian rockets had earned a reputation for reliability in the past, launch failures in recent years has called into doubt Russia's ability to maintain the same high standards of manufacturing.      Glitches found in Russia's Proton and Soyuz rockets in 2016 were traced to manufacturing flaws. Roscosmos sent more than 70 rocket engines back to production lines to replace faulty components, a move that resulted in a yearlong break in Proton launches and badly dented Russia's niche in the global market for commercial satellite launches.      In August, the space station crew spotted a hole in a Russian Soyuz capsule docked to the orbiting outpost that caused a brief loss of air pressure before being patched. Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin has raised wide concern by saying that the leak was a drill hole that was made intentionally during manufacturing or in orbit. He didn't say if he suspected any of the station's crew.      ___      Isachenkov reported from Moscow.

Mission managers observed inclement weather at Dragon’s splashdown site in the Pacific Ocean and decided against Dragon’s return to Earth today.      Meanwhile, Dragon’s hatch remains open and the Expedition 58 crew is tending to time-sensitive experiments targeted for return and analysis back on Earth. The Canadarm2 robotic arm has the Dragon firmly in its grips while the cargo vehicle is still attached to the Harmony module.      Robotics controllers will command the Canadarm2 to uninstall Dragon from Harmony on Saturday afternoon then slowly maneuver the U.S. space freighter to its release position. The Canadarm2 will then be commanded to release Dragon Sunday at 3:36 a.m. EST as astronaut Anne McClain monitors from the cupola. NASA TV will broadcast the departure live without commentary starting Sunday at 3:15 a.m.      Today, the three space station residents are back on science and maintenance duties with Dragon poised for a weekend departure. McClain of NASA is checking out and preserving the space research meant for return inside Dragon.      Flight Engineer David Saint-Jacques of the Canadian Space Agency assisted McClain first thing Thursday morning. He then moved on to the Vascular Echo study scanning his leg’s femoral artery with an ultrasound device to understand how living in space affects the cardiovascular system.      Cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko explored ways to improve piloting techniques in space and participated in a psychological assessment. The four-time station resident also maintained Russian life support systems aboard the orbital lab.      Back on Earth, NASA and SpaceX are continuing to work on the activities leading toward the Demo-1, uncrewed flight test to the International Space Station. NASA and SpaceX are now targeting no earlier than February for the launch of Demo-1 to complete hardware testing and joint reviews. NASA and SpaceX will confirm a new target date after coordination with the Eastern Range and the International Space Station Program. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||Summary:","output":"The failed launch of a Soyuz rocket carrying US astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin to the International Space Station (ISS) has highlighted the precarious state of the Russian space program, which is currently the only link for delivering astronauts to the ISS.

First Amendment, ‘Patron Saint’ of Protesters, Is Embraced by Corporations WASHINGTON — Liberals used to love the First Amendment. But that was in an era when courts used it mostly to protect powerless people like civil rights activists and war protesters. These days, a provocative new study says, there has been a “corporate takeover of the First Amendment.” The assertion is backed by data, and it comes from an unlikely source: John C. Coates IV, who teaches business law at Harvard and used to be a partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the prominent corporate law firm. “Corporations have begun to displace individuals as the direct beneficiaries of the First Amendment,” Professor Coates wrote. The trend, he added, is “recent but accelerating.” Professor Coates’s study was only partly concerned with the Supreme Court’s recent decisions amplifying the role of money in politics. “It’s not just Citizens United,” he said in an interview, referring to the 2010 decision that allowed unlimited independent spending by corporations in elections. His study, he said, analyzed First Amendment challenges from businesses to an array of economic regulations. Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia, described the shift in First Amendment doctrine in 2013 in The New Republic. “Once the patron saint of protesters and the disenfranchised, the First Amendment has become the darling of economic libertarians and corporate lawyers who have recognized its power to immunize private enterprise from legal restraint,” Professor Wu wrote. “Madison’s Music,” a new book by Burt Neuborne, a law professor at New York University, gives a detailed history of the transformation of First Amendment law. In his account, “the American right discovered the First Amendment” in the early 1970s. “An expansive conception of free speech became attractive to Republican justices,” he wrote, “both because robust free-speech protection fit neatly into the right’s skeptical, deregulatory approach to government generally, and because it encouraged vigorous transmission by powerful speakers of the right’s newly energized collection of ideas.” Those conservative justices, Professor Neuborne wrote, found willing allies in liberal justices long committed to free speech. In the next two decades, the Supreme Court continued to protect dissent, twice voting to strike down laws banning flag burning. But now, Professor Neuborne wrote, broad coalitions of justices also voted to protect the powerful. In 1976 alone, he wrote, the court shielded both unrestricted election spending by rich people, “giving the 1 percent a tangible reason to celebrate a muscular First Amendment,” and commercial advertising, “giving corporate management a strong stake in the First Amendment.” By the time the left woke up and realized it had made “a Faustian bargain,” Professor Neuborne wrote, “the bipartisan coalition had generated an enormously powerful body of precedent establishing an imperial free speech clause.” The case on commercial speech, Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, was a turning point, Professor Coates found in his study. After that ruling, the average number of First Amendment cases in the Supreme Court involving businesses started to rise to 2.2 a year from 1.5, and the number involving individuals started to fall, to 3.6 from 4.3. More striking, the success rates for both groups increased, but far more for businesses. Individuals won 55 percent of the time, up from 41 percent. Businesses also won 55 percent of the time, up from 20 percent. Before 1976, First Amendment challenges from corporations generally involved companies in the business of free expression, like newspapers, book publishers and film producers. More recently, companies have filed free-speech challenges to laws regulating how ordinary products may be marketed or advertised. Professor Coates also analyzed data from federal appeals courts, finding that “businesses are growing steadily more aggressive in their use of the First Amendment.” Court dockets these days are full of free-speech challenges from pharmaceutical firms, tobacco companies, miners, meat producers and airlines. Such lawsuits, he wrote, have pernicious consequences for both free enterprise and the rule of law. Corporations are diverting resources from research and innovation to litigation, he wrote. “Concentrated, moneyed interests, represented by those in control of the country’s largest business corporations,” he wrote, “are increasingly able to turn law into a lottery, reducing law’s predictability, impairing property rights, and increasing the share of the economy devoted to rent-seeking rather than productive activity.” The court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has been receptive to arguments based on corporations’ free-speech rights. In a recent essay, Laurence H. Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, offered a cautious partial defense of the Citizens United decision. But he said it was an instance of a larger phenomenon. “It is part of a trend in First Amendment law that is transforming that body of doctrine into a charter of largely untrammeled libertarianism,” he wrote, “in which the regulation of virtually all forms of speech and all kinds of speakers is treated with the same heavy dose of judicial skepticism, with exceptions perversely calculated to expose particularly vulnerable and valuable sorts of expression to unconvincingly justified suppression.” Professor Tribe gave examples of the sorts of people whose First Amendment arguments have not fared well in the Roberts court: students, prisoners, pacifists and whistle-blowers. Floyd Abrams, a leading First Amendment lawyer who has defended The New York Times and was on the winning side in Citizens United, reflected on the trend toward protecting the powerful in a speech last week at Temple University. “There is truth in the proposition that a number of recent First Amendment victories in recent years have been on behalf of the ‘haves’ — some of them corporations, some individuals,” he said. “But that is no basis for concluding that the decisions were wrongly analyzed or wrongly decided.” A version of this article appears in print on March 24, 2015, on page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Corporations Take First Amendment and Apply It Liberally.

Background: The Goo Goo Dolls (originally Sex Maggot) are an American rock band formed in 1986 in Buffalo, New York, by vocalist and guitarist John Rzeznik, vocalist and bassist Robby Takac, and drummer George Tutuska. Mike Malinin was the band's drummer from January 1995 until December 27, 2013 (but not made an official member until 1998). Although renowned for their commercially successful 1998 single \\"Iris\\", they have had several other notable and popular singles including \\"Name\\" and \\"Naked\\" from 1995's A Boy Named Goo, \\"Slide\\", \\"Black Balloon\\", \\"Dizzy\\", and \\"Broadway\\" from 1998's Dizzy Up the Girl, \\"Here Is Gone\\" from 2002's Gutterflower, \\"Better Days\\", \\"Give a Little Bit\\", and \\"Stay with You\\" from 2006's Context: The band's original lineup included John Rzeznik (vocals, guitar), Robby Takac (vocals, bass), and George Tutuska (drums, percussion). Takac and Tutuska had been long-time friends in school and met Rzeznik while he was playing in the band The Beaumonts with Takac's cousin, Paul Takac and close friend Michael Harvey who was the inspiration for the band. The trio picked their name from a True Detective ad for a toy called a Goo Goo Doll. \\"We were young and we were a garage band not trying to get a deal. We had a gig that night and needed a name. It's the best we came up with, and for some reason it stuck. If I had five more minutes, I definitely would have picked a better name\\", John stated. With Takac as their lead singer, the band released their first album, Goo Goo Dolls in 1987 on Mercenary Records, but was picked up in 1988 by Celluloid Records, a larger record company. They played around Buffalo's underground music circuit opening for punk bands such as SNFU, Dag Nasty, ALL, The Dead Milkmen, Gang Green, Doughboys, and DRI and playing with fellow Buffalo bands. The band released its second album Jed in 1989.  The band released its third album, Hold Me Up, in 1990 and featured Rzeznik as the lead vocalist on five tracks, including the single, \\"There You Are\\"--as well as their then concert favorite, \\"Two Days in February\\". After being embraced by local college radio and punk scenes (including playing such venues as CBGB), the Goo Goo Dolls' third release incorporated elements of heavy metal, pop rock, and punk rock. In 1991, the song \\"I'm Awake Now\\" was recorded for the soundtrack of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.  Superstar Car Wash, released in 1993, received significant media attention. The critical success and encouraging sales of their last album resulted in a larger budget from Metal Blade Records. The album was partially recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. \\"We Are the Normal\\" (the single for which Rzeznik asked frontman Paul Westerberg of The Replacements to write the lyrics) received a major push toward play on college and independent radio, while its video was displayed on MTV's 120 Minutes program. \\"Fallin' Down\\" made it onto the 1993 soundtrack of Pauly Shore's hit film Son in Law. Question: is there any other intersting facts about the article that is significant?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are more interesting facts about the Goo Goo Dolls. Here's one for you: The Goo Goo Dolls became very famous because of their song \\"Iris\\" which was released in 1998.

Input: Review: Alan Curtis has a loud, violent sounding argument with his wife, slams out of his apartment, has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large hat in a bar (run by Andrew Tombes, in a nice villainous part for a change), and returns to find his wife dead and the police, led by Thomas Gomez waiting for him. His attempts to prove his alibi - that he was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that he can think of (Tombes, Elisha Cook) claims there was never any such person. He ends up with no alibi, although his secretary (who secretly loves him) Ellen Raines believes him. Convicted after a trial, he is awaiting his death sentence. Raines starts going out after the truth, discovering that Gomez has some doubts of his own. She also finds an ally in a friend of Curtis, Franchot Tone, who was apparently out of town the night of the crime. Will she clear Curtis in time? THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish (the great noir writer Cornell Woolrich). As movie fans know from other works by Woolrich (LEOPARD MAN, THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES, REAR WINDOW, NO MAN OF HER OWN) one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere. The missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate, sending him messages that she arrived, if he still has her jewelry. The mentalist may really be able to predict tragedy - or was he plotting the murder of his old partner, now an oil millionaire? Did a leopard kill the young women, or is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge? Is the young woman, claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck, actually an impostor? Here it is Raines and Gomez (with an assist by Tone) trying to prove Curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing - and if he did see her, why is nobody else able to recall seeing her? The problem with the story really is Curtis's personality - he gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime he did not commit. In reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed. However, in defense of Curtis's collapse, it also happens to other people in various films: Gary Cooper, in MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, gets so disgusted about the framing he gets as delusional and mad by Douglas Dumbrille and his minions that he does not defend himself at first, until the people who would depend on his help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken his sense of responsibility. But Curtis just seems to give up. In normal circumstances Raines, Gomez, and everyone else would not care if Curtis didn't.But the film survives this weakness. The slow unraveling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for Raines with Tombes on a deserted elevated platform and Elisha Cook at a jazz session. Gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking his alibi again. And the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of Raines and Gomez until the concluding minutes of the film. If it is not as great a film as DOUBLE INDEMNITY or THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE or THE MALTESE FALCON, it holds up pretty well until the moment Curtis and Raines are reunited at the end.

Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years.  and the situation: Two brothers got sick and weren't feeling well. Strangely enough they found out they were infected with viruses. Tom was infected with human papillomavirus, while Chris was infected with hepatitis.  Answer the following question: Which brother had a higher chance of developing a chronic viral infection? Answer:","output":"To determine which of the two brothers, Tom and Chris, had a higher chance of developing a chronic viral infection, we need to briefly examine the characteristics and possible outcomes of the specific viruses they were infected with. Tom was infected with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a group of more than 200 related viruses, with more than 40 of them specifically affecting the genital area. These viruses can be classified into two categories: low-risk and high-risk types. Low-risk types can cause warts in or around the genitals and anus, while high-risk types can lead to cancers such as cervical, anal, penile, and some types of throat cancers. However, it is important to note that not all HPV infections lead to cancer, and most HPV infections actually resolve on their own with time, without causing any health problems. On the other hand, Chris was infected with hepatitis, which refers to an inflammation of the liver cells and damage to the liver. There are several types of hepatitis viruses, including hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Hepatitis A and E are typically short-term infections, while hepatitis B, C, and D can become chronic infections in some cases. Chronic hepatitis B and C, in particular, can lead to severe health issues such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Given this information, it can be concluded that Chris, who was infected with hepatitis, had a higher chance of developing a chronic viral infection as compared to Tom, who was infected with human papillomavirus. While both infections pose potential risks, chronic hepatitis infections are more likely to lead to severe health complications and can directly result in liver-related issues, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. In contrast, HPV infections often resolve on their own and only lead to cancer in a fraction of cases."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why.

Paragraph:  Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary.  His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing.

At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw.  But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road.  As he did so he glanced back.  A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it.

Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Centuries ago, man discovered that removing moisture from food helps to store it, and that the easiest way to do this is to expose the food to sun and wind. In this way the North American Indians produce pemmican(dried meat ground into powder and made into cakes), the Scandinavians make stockfish and the Arabs dried dates. All foods include water--cabbage and other leaf vegetables contains as much as 93% water, potatoes and other root vegetables 80%, lean meat 75% and fish, anything from 80% to 60%, depending on how fatty it is. If this water is removed, the activity of the bacteria which cause food to go bad is checked. Fruit is sun-dried in Asia Minor, Greece, Spain and other Mediterranean countries, and also in California, South Africa and Australia. Various methods are used, but in general, the fruit is spread out on trays in drying yards in the hot sun. Nowadays most foods are dried mechanically. The method of such dehydration is to put food in chambers through which hot air is blown at temperatures of about 110degC at entry to about 43degC at exit. This is the usual method for drying such things as vegetables, minced meat, and fish. Dried foods take up less room and weigh less than the same food packed in cans or frozen, and they do not need to be stored in special conditions. For these reasons they are invaluable to the climbers, explorers and soldiers in battle, who have little storage space. They are also popular with housewives because it takes so little time to cook them. Usually it is just a case of replacing the dried-out moisture with boiling water.

To better understand the sentence's meaning, let's break down the elements of the sentence. The sentence can be understood as having two primary parts: 1. \\"Then he took a piece of iron the shape of the horse's foot\\" 2. \\"...and clapped it on, and drove some nails through the shoe quite into its hoof, so that the shoe was firmly on\\" In the first part of the sentence, \\"the horse's foot\\" refers to the foot of the horse itself. The piece of iron, which is \\"the shape of the horse's foot,\\" has been created in the form of a horseshoe to be fitted on the horse's hoof. The second part of the sentence demonstrates the actual process of attaching the horseshoe to the horse's hoof. In this context, \\"it\\" refers to the piece of iron (the horseshoe) mentioned in the first part of the sentence. The person (presumably a farrier) is essentially clapping the horseshoe onto the horse's hoof, and then driving nails through the horseshoe and into the horse's hoof to secure it in place. In summary, \\"horse\\" in this sentence refers to the animal, and \\"it\\" refers to the piece of iron (the horseshoe) shaped like the horse's foot.

Two Harvard University researchers announced Friday that they have found a second parchment manuscript copy of the Declaration of Independence in a tiny records office in southern England.      The only other parchment copy is maintained by the National Archives in Washington, D.C., researchers Emily Sneff and Danielle Allen said in a statement.      The newly discovered document — which the two have dated to the 1780s — was found in the town of Chichester archives, and is believed to have originally belonged to Duke of Richmond who was known as the “Radical Duke,’’ for the support he gave to Americans during the Revolutionary War, the researchers said.      Advertisement      The parchment was likely made in New York or Philadelphia. The researchers are still trying to determine the person who wrote the document and who paid for the foundational document of the United States to be copied.

Sign up for more newsletters here      The signatories on the Sussex version of the document are not broken down by state, something that distinguished it from the Declaration in the National Archives, the researchers said.      In an academic paper, the researchers say the document probably was commissioned by James Wilson of Pennsylvania, who later helped draft the Constitution and was among the original justices appointed to the Supreme Court.      “The team hypothesizes that this detail supported efforts, made by Wilson and his allies during the Constitutional Convention and ratification process, to argue that the authority of the Declaration rested on a unitary national people, and not on a federation of states,’’ the researchers wrote in the statement.      The team, working with British officials, is working to carefully test the document in a way that will not damage the parchment.      Advertisement      According to the National Archives, the Massachusetts Historical Commission holds one of 26 copies of the Declaration of Independence prepared by John Dunlap, the printer for the Congressional Congress, after its signing on July 4, 1776.      John R. Ellement can be reached at ellement@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @JREbosglobe ||||| It started with a one-line entry from the catalog of a tiny records office in the town of Chichester, in the south of England: “Manuscript copy, on parchment, of the Declaration in Congress of the thirteen United States of America.”      As part of an effort to assemble a database on every known edition of the Declaration of Independence, Emily Sneff, a researcher with the Declaration Resources Project, stumbled upon the listing in August 2015. Although she didn’t think much of it at the time, that short description would send Sneff and Harvard’s Danielle Allen on a two-year journey into American history.      “I’d found vague descriptions of other copies of the Declaration that turned out to be 19th-century reproductions of the signed parchment in the National Archives, so that was what I was expecting,” Sneff said of her initial impression based on the catalog listing. “What struck me as significant was that it said manuscript on parchment.”      Sneff contacted the archive, the West Sussex Record Office, whose staff mailed her a disc with photos of the document.      “When I looked at it closely, I started to see details, like names that weren’t in the right order — John Hancock isn’t listed first, there’s a mark at the top that looks like an erasure, the text has very little punctuation in it — and it’s in a handwriting I hadn’t seen before,” she said. “As those details started adding up, I brought it to Danielle’s attention and we realized this was different from any other copy we had seen.”      “We knew we had a mystery,” said Allen, the James Bryant Conant University Professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. “We had a big, big mystery.      “There are three key questions we want to answer,” Allen continued. “One is: Can we date this parchment based on the material evidence? Second: Who commissioned it, and why? And third: How did it get to England?”      Allen and Sneff are now providing some answers with a pair of papers. The first, currently in the final revision stage with the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, uses handwriting analysis, examination of the parchment preparation and styling, and spelling errors in the names of the signers to date the Sussex Declaration to the 1780s.      The second paper, presented at a Yale University conference on Friday, argues that the document was probably commissioned by James Wilson of Pennsylvania, who later helped draft the Constitution and was among the original justices of the Supreme Court.      But the document isn’t simply a previously unknown piece of history — it provides a unique window into the political upheavals of early America. In the immediate aftermath of the July 4, 1776, signing, Allen noted, there was a period of “breaking news” in which the Declaration was reproduced and printed in a variety of formats as the news spread through the colonies and eventually made its way across the Atlantic to England.      “The versions that people would have seen in July and August 1776 were broadsides and newspapers, starting with John Dunlap’s broadside, which was printed on the night of July 4,” Sneff said. “Those copies would have made their way across to England as well — there are Dunlap broadsides in their National Archives.”      But it wasn’t until approximately a decade later that the Sussex Declaration was produced, amid a tumultuous period for the new nation.      “Victory was not sweet,” Allen said. “There was financial disaster, the Articles of Confederation were not working … so the 1780s were a period of great instability, despite victory. And this parchment belongs to that decade.”      Among the chief political debates of the era, Allen said, was whether the new nation had been founded on the basis of the people’s authority or the authority of the states. By reordering the names of the signers, perhaps the most conspicuous feature of the parchment, the Sussex Declaration comes down squarely on one side of the argument.      On most documents of the era, Allen said, the protocol was for members of each state delegation to sign together, with signatures typically running either down the page or from left to right, with the names of the states labeling each group. An exception was made for a small number of particularly important documents — including the Declaration, which was signed from right to left, and which omitted the names of the states, though the names were still grouped by state.      “But the Sussex Declaration scrambles the names so they are no longer grouped by state,” Allen said. “It is the only version of the Declaration that does that, with the exception of an engraving from 1836 that derives from it. This is really a symbolic way of saying we are all one people, or ‘one community,’ to quote James Wilson.”      Allen and Sneff will continue to probe how the parchment reached England. Also, they are working on a project in collaboration with the West Sussex Record Office, the British Library, and the Library of Congress to perform hyper-spectral imaging on the parchment and other non-invasive studies in the hope of reading some text that appears to have been scraped away at the top of the document. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Two researchers from Harvard University have found a second parchment manuscript copy of the Declaration of Independence in a little records office in southern England.

UPDATED:. 14:08 EST, 14 November 2012. Shock: Frankie Dettori, pictured with his wife. Catherine, faces a world ban after a failed drugs test. French authorities were 'tipped off' that Frankie Dettori – Britain's best-known jockey – had taken a banned substance, it emerged today. The 41-year-old three-time champion jockey was shocked when officials demanded a drugs test and has been left devastated by the failure that is threatening to derail his career. He faces a hearing before the medical committee of the French racing authorities next week after testing positive for cocaine or a derivative of it while riding Longchamp on September 16. A well-placed racing source in Paris told the Evening Standard today that Dettori 'was taken by surprise by the test, following a tip-off from a third party'. Dettori is currently in Dubai, where he has stopped off after riding in the Melbourne Cup on November 6. Sources have told the Daily Mail the Italian has been ‘knocked for six’ by the positive test, which was ‘a moment of madness rather than a genuine addiction.’ Dettori’s withdrawal from his mounts at Doncaster on Saturday was unrelated to the imminent disciplinary hearing. However, Coral has removed Dettori from its 2013 champion jockey betting with the threat of a long ban hanging over him. Fellow jockey Kieran Fallon was handed a six-month ban by the France Galop in 2006 when he tested positive to cocaine for the first time. A ban of such magnitude, which would not start until Dettori’s disciplinary process was completed, would potentially rule out Dettori until May or June of next year. Coral spokesman David Stevens said: ‘If, as reports suggest, Frankie Dettori has failed a test involving cocaine, a six-month suspension is likely, and such a ban would rule him out of a title bid next year.’ The revelation has caused a sensation. in the racing world. Dettori, famous for his exuberance and flying. dismount, was awarded an MBE in 2000 and has become a major TV. celebrity. He was a one-time captain on the BBC's A Question of Sport and co-owner of a restaurant with chef Marco Pierre White. In the dock: The 41-year-old tested positive for a. prohibited substance following a meeting at Longchamp racecourse in. Paris in September, where he took part in four races. A. three-time champion jockey, he has won more than 500 group races in his. career. But his exploits in the saddle achieved legendary status at. Ascot in 1996, when he won all seven races in a row. In an interview, Detorri said: 'I. won the last race on Fujiyama Crest. I bought him when he retired and. now he lives peacefully in my field. 'My wife Catherine made me a bronze. cast of his foot – it reminds me of the wonderful horse that made me. famous.' Under reciprocal arrangements in place. between international racing authorities, any ban imposed in one. country would apply internationally. Dettori's solicitor,. Christopher Stewart-Moore, said in a statement: 'I can confirm that, as a consequence. of a positive test at Longchamp on September 16, he will be the subject. of an inquiry by the Medical Committee of France Galop next week. Frankie's folly: Frankie Dettori rides ex-racehorse Monsignor, left, to carry the Olympic Flame around the parade ring at Ascot Racecourse. Right, his famous dismount after riding all seven winners in one meeting. Dettori wins the Prince of Wales's Stakes, his 45th Royal Ascot victory, on Rewilding in June 2011. Rides: 3,422. Wins: 943. Strike rate: 28 per cent. Group One victories: 110 (262 victories at Listed level or higher) Dubai World Cup wins: Three - Dubai Millennium (2000), Moon Ballad (2003) & Electrocutionist (206) He won 14 British Classics (nine riding for Godolphing) On September 28, 1996, he partnered all seven winners on the card at Ascot. 'In compliance with, and out of. respect for, the regulations of France Galop he will not be commenting. further until the France Galop procedures have been completed.' Dettori and his wife, with whom he has five children, were not at their home near Newmarket, Suffolk, last night. A relative who answered the door said:. 'I don't know anything about it. Frankie is in Los Angeles and. Catherine is in Hertfordshire with one of the children.' The jockey parted company with racing stable Godolphin last month after an 18-year relationship. Dettori was expected to continue. working his contract until the end of this year but Godolphin said at. the time that 'the retainer was not really working'. In 1993, Dettori. received a caution for possession of cocaine after he had been to watch. Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday play at Wembley in the FA Cup final. Speaking about it in 2010, he said: 'That wasn't about losing weight. That was for fun.' Describing how a 'fast' lifestyle took. over from his focus on horse racing when he began earning big money, he. added: 'Everyone wanted to be with me. I'd go clubbing, there was. cocaine and there I was like the big show-off, the idiot.' Sporting minds: In 2002 Frankie became a team captain on A Question of Sport. Family man: Frankie with wife Catherine son Leo and daughter Ella at the premiere of The Chronicles Of Narnia in December 2005. The jockey also had a professional DJ. booth built in his home. He said: 'It started off as a bit of a joke,. but now I can't imagine life without it. 'When we have people round and the. champagne's flowing I start playing music, but I usually get kicked off. pretty fast because everybody wants a go.' The race day at Longchamp in September. is used to trial horses for the highlight of the racecourse's calendar,. the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, which is held in October. He finished second in one race, third in two others and was unplaced in the fourth. Jockey Kieren Fallon was banned for. six months by France Galop in 2006 after a positive test. It banned him. for another 18 months after a second positive test in August 2007. Frankie Dettori receives his prize from The Queen after winning the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes on Daylami at Ascot in July, 1999. Highlights:","output":"1. Frankie Dettori, a famous jockey, failed a drug test and might get banned from racing. 2. He was tested for drugs in France and the results showed he had taken something not allowed. 3. Frankie was very surprised and sad about this news. 4. He will have a meeting with French racing people next week to see what happens. 5.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope for hides? is inside the article: There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

Question: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands.  Which parcel of land had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the two parcels of land step-by-step and justify our conclusion: Step 1: Understand the properties of each parcel Tom's land is forested, which means it has an abundance of trees, shrubs, and other vegetation. Bill's land, on the other hand, is covered with grasslands, which typically consist of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Step 2: Evaluate the water retention capacity of each parcel Forested land has a higher water retention capacity compared to grasslands. The trees and other plants in the forest help to retain water in the soil through their extensive root systems. Moreover, the forest floor is often covered with leaves and organic matter, which can further slow down the percolation of water into the soil. In grasslands, the root systems of grasses may not be as extensive as those of trees, and there is less organic matter on the ground to slow down the water percolation. Step 3: Determine which parcel is more likely to have excess water percolating downward Considering the factors in Steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that the parcel of land with an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers is more likely to be Tom's forested land than Bill's grassland. The presence of trees and other vegetation, along with the forest floor's ability to slow down water percolation, increases the likelihood of excess water being retained in the soil and then percolating downward in Tom's parcel."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Bacteria enters the body - Bloodstream - Cells in the body are attacked - Cells are killed - Different kinds of sickness are formed.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose bacteria is on the skin and is ingested happens, how will it affect bacteria will enter the bloodstream.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"In order to fully address the question, let us first break down the given process and the perturbation hypothesis: Process: 1. Bacteria enters the body. 2. Bacteria enters the bloodstream. 3. Cells in the body are attacked. 4. Cells are killed. 5. Different kinds of sickness are formed. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose bacteria is on the skin and is ingested, will it have any effect on the aforementioned process? To answer this question, we must first understand how bacteria on the skin might enter the body when ingested and if it has direct or indirect effects on the process. When bacteria are present on the skin, they can be transferred to the mouth and ingested via direct touch (e.g., touching the mouth with unwashed hands) or indirect contact (e.g., through contaminated food or utensils). Once the bacteria have been ingested, they will enter the gastrointestinal tract, specifically the stomach and intestines. The stomach has a highly acidic environment with a pH around 1.5 to 3.5. This acidic environment functions as a defense mechanism against ingested pathogens, as it can kill or deactivate many types of bacteria. However, some bacteria are capable of surviving in this harsh environment, such as Helicobacter pylori, which is responsible for stomach ulcers. Other bacteria may be present in food that has been stored or prepared improperly, leading to foodborne illnesses. Once the bacteria have survived the stomach's acidity, they can enter the intestinal tract, where they can adhere to the mucosal surfaces or invade the epithelial cells lining the intestines. From here, bacteria may enter the bloodstream either directly, by breaching the intestinal barrier, or indirectly, by producing toxins that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The direct access of bacteria into the bloodstream can result in bacteremia -- the presence of bacteria in the blood. This occurrence can potentially lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition as a result of the body's response to an infection, and can progress to septic shock. In these cases, the process described above is affected as bacteria will enter the bloodstream and may attack cells in the body, leading to cell death and the formation of different sicknesses. Alternatively, the indirect effect of ingested bacteria on the bloodstream can happen when they produce toxins within the gastrointestinal tract that are then absorbed into the bloodstream. These toxins can cause damage to cells and tissues throughout the body, including the liver and kidneys. This pathway also has the potential to affect the process by causing the cells in the body to be attacked, leading to cell death and the development of various illnesses. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis does have potential direct and indirect effects on the process. When bacteria on the skin are ingested, they might be able to enter the bloodstream either directly by breaching the intestinal barrier, or indirectly by producing toxins that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This can lead to the body's cells being attacked, cell death, and the subsequent development of different sicknesses. However, it is essential to note that not all ingested bacteria will have these effects, as some pathogens may be killed or deactivated in the stomach's acidic environment or are unable to invade the intestinal barrier."},{"instruction":"There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Please answer this question: who has written the most books in the world?","output":"Identifying the person who has written the most books in the world is not an easy task, as numerous prolific authors have published a significant number of works throughout history. However, one name consistently appears in this context: Lope de Vega, a Spanish playwright, poet, and novelist who was immensely prolific during his lifetime. Lope de Vega, full name Félix Lope de Vega y Carpio (born November 25, 1562, Madrid, Spain—died August 27, 1635, Madrid), is considered one of the most significant figures in Spanish Golden Age literature and one of the most productive authors in the history of world literature. He is best known for his contributions to Spanish theater, which were instrumental in defining the structure and form of plays during the Golden Age. While precise figures are difficult to provide, it is estimated that Lope de Vega wrote more than 1,500 plays, with roughly 470 of them having survived to this day. Many of these theatrical works were both popular and influential throughout Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries, making him an undeniable force in the world of literature. He is particularly noted for his creation of the Spanish comedia, a distinctive genre of theater that combined elements of comedy, tragedy, and historical drama. Aside from his theatrical works, Lope de Vega also wrote a large number of poems, which further contribute to his impressive tally of literary works. His poetic opus contains more than 3,000 sonnets, several epic poems, and numerous ballads, elegies, and other lyrical works. He also authored several prose works, such as the pastoral novel \\"La Arcadia\\" and the Byzantine novel \\"El peregrino en su patria.\\" While there are other writers who have produced a substantial quantity of works, such as Ryuho Okawa (a Japanese spiritual leader and author with more than 2,500 books) or Isaac Asimov (a prolific science fiction writer with over 500 books), Lope de Vega's prodigious output places him at the forefront of the most prolific authors in global literary history. His substantial influence on Spanish theater, poetry, and prose has solidified his status as one of the most significant literary figures in the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Learn the difference between a true antique, near antique, vintage, and collectable before you start searching for antiques.   True antique is a collectable at least a century old, according to the majority of antique dealers.  This is based on tradition and the customs laws of various countries, though some societies define it as anytime before 1930. True antiques are considered desirable because of their age, beauty, rarity, condition, or personal connection.  Near antique is an item between 75 to 99 years old.  Vintage is a broad definition that means 'of a certain time'.  It is the description used for a range of collectibles, and especially those from the 40s, 50s and 60s.  Collectables are any items valued or sought at by collectors. These can be from any era and vary in price depending on rarity and condition. The best antique buys are ones that match your personal interests. Suppose you're an art lover, for example. What would you like to obtain? A certain kind of object, such as antique sculptures? A piece from a certain artist? Artwork from a certain period (ie: post-impressionism)? Think about your personal interests and use that to narrow your search.  Read guides about your special interests to determine what exactly you want to collect. Within a certain era or type of item, there are many different brands or styles to consider. The value of your item will vary greatly depending on age, brand, and condition. Keep these three criteria in mind as you research. If you're collecting as a hobby, buy what you love, not what is most valuable. You'll want to collect what you enjoy, not what costs most. If you want to make money buying and selling antiques, research valuable antique items within a certain era or subset. You will work much more efficiently if you can narrow your focus. Choose a focus with high value among antique hobbyists and current trending interest. Whether you collect or sell, have your items appraised. This is to make sure your insurance covers the value of all your antiques in the event of theft, damage or loss. Appraisal will also give you a good idea of what your items are worth. Before you begin shopping, decide beforehand how much you want to spend on antiques. Even the most seasoned antique buyers can get carried away and buy more than they can afford. Keep a close eye on your funds and promise yourself not to exceed them, even if you want to later.  If you are selling your items, think about how quickly you will be able to sell the item and for how much (in as accurate an estimate as you can). When you find a valuable item that you think will sell quickly, you may justify going over your budget a little. Use your best judgment, and don't buy anything that will put you in serious debt. Learn from your mistakes. If you overpay on an item or bought something worth less than you thought, that's just part of antique collecting. Like other hobbies, you'll get better as you go along. Summary:","output":"This article educates us about different categories of old items - true antiques (at least 100 years old), near antiques (75 to 99 years old), vintage items (from a specific time like the 40s, 50s and 60s), and collectables (items that people like to collect). The article also gives advice on collecting these items, suggesting that you should collect things you love, unless you plan to sell them. If you're selling, you should try and find items from a specific period or type that are valuable and popular. It's also important to get your items valued, so you know how much they're worth, and always keep an eye on your budget. You'll get better at collecting or selling antiques over time, even if you make some mistakes at the start."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the sentence \\"a man cutting giant blocks of ice.\\", is the sentence \\"A man is sitting down with a cold drink.\\" a true sentence?","output":"The sentence \\"A man is sitting down with a cold drink\\" is not necessarily true based on the information provided in the sentence \\"a man cutting giant blocks of ice.\\" Although it could be inferred that perhaps the man could use the ice to make a cold drink, there is not enough evidence in the initial sentence to confirm that the man is indeed sitting down and enjoying a cold drink. It is essential to look at these two sentences as separate instances without making assumptions about a potential connection between them. The first sentence describes an action undertaken by a man, which is cutting giant blocks of ice. This could suggest numerous possible scenarios; it might be his profession, or he could be cutting ice for a specific purpose, like an ice sculpture or to provide ice for an event. The second sentence, on the other hand, creates a completely different scenario. While it is true that the presence of ice often implies that a cold drink might be involved, the provided information does not make any direct reference to the man using the ice he is cutting for a drink. He could be sitting down and enjoying a cold beverage unrelated to the activity of ice-cutting, or he could even be taking a break after cutting the ice. Both sentences can stand independently, and there is no clear correlation between them. In conclusion, the sentence \\"A man is sitting down with a cold drink\\" cannot be considered true based solely on the details given in the sentence \\"a man cutting giant blocks of ice.\\" Without more information or context, it is impossible to determine a definite connection between the two situations described. The man might end up using the ice for a cold drink at some point, but that is not directly implied or stated in the original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After visiting a now-deserted clinic where she used to take her daughter (she has footage of it on a home video of herself and Angela), and finding strange pictures of angels there, Claudia calls a recently retired cop, Massera (Karra Elejalde), to investigate the matter. She also gives him a boot she found on the site, believing it to have been left for her to find. Massera's research appears to corroborate the hypothesis that Angela is alive, revealing that a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela's death. He teams up with tabloid journalist Quiroga (Tristan Ulloa), a reporter for a magazine of parapsychology, after Quiroga receives in the mail a disturbing videotape which has Claudia's phone number written on the label.

I read this background article the other day: Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice reduces the planet's average albedo, possibly resulting in global warming in a positive feedback mechanism. Research shows that the Arctic may become ice free in the summer for the first time in human history within by 2040. Estimates vary for when the last time the Arctic was ice free: 65 million years ago when fossils indicate that plants existed there to as few as 5,500 years ago; ice and ocean cores going back 8000 years to the last warm period or 125,000 during the last intraglacial period.Warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh meltwater to enter the north Atlantic, possibly disrupting global ocean current patterns. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.As the extent of sea ice diminishes and sea level rises, the effect of storms such as the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 on open water increases, as does possible salt-water damage to vegetation on shore at locations such as the Mackenzie's river delta as stronger storm surges become more likely.Global warming has increased encounters between polar bears and humans. Reduced sea ice due to melting is causing polar bears to search for new sources of food. Beginning in December 2018 and coming to an apex in February 2019, a mass invasion of polar bears into the archipelago of Novaya Zemlya caused local authorities to declare a state of emergency. Dozens of polar bears were seen entering homes and public buildings and inhabited areas.  I am facing a new situation today: Mike was reading about climate change.

Individual instructions will appear on the product's packaging, but most lip plumpers should be applied to clean lips and should start showing results within 5 minutes. Mix 2 teaspoons of cinnamon oil with a 1 teaspoon of coconut oil or Vitamin E oil. Apply a thin layer of the mixture to your lips with a small applicator brush, and let it sit for 15 minutes before applying any lipstick.

Keep this mixture in a jar or tube for continued use. There are numerous natural ways to plump up your lips, including the oil from red peppers.

The film, narrated primarily by McKinney herself and supplemented by other interviews with primary characters and experts, is presented by animated headlines, newspaper photos, and brief televised news reports from the time of the case. McKinney details her upbringing as a charismatic young beauty queen with a self-reported IQ of 168. In search of a \\"clean-cut, all-American boy\\" for a potential husband, McKinney is introduced to Kirk Anderson, a young Mormon man on the eve of his  religious mission. McKinney states that she and Anderson fell madly in love and that they were engaged to be married, but that she mistrusted the Mormon church and its hold over Anderson, declaring the church to be a \\"cult\\" that had \\"brainwashed\\" him. Former Mormon turned activist Troy Williams offers insight into Mormon practices, beliefs, and attitudes to explain how Mormonism might seem cult-like to one not raised in the religion. When Anderson was sent to England on his mission, McKinney, believing that the church elders deliberately separated them, recruited a pilot (Jackson Shaw, who appears in interviews) to fly her, her friend Keith \\"K.J.\\" May, and a hired bodyguard named Gil Parker to England on a \\"rescue mission\\" McKinney framed in terms of a romantic caper.

Context: I will never own a Chanel suit. It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect.

Article: Hamsters like to be awake at night, so the best time to spend time with your hamster is after the sun has gone down. For this reason, hamsters make great pets for night owls. Be aware that if you try to pick up your hamster during the day, it will be more likely to bite you. To help keep your hamster happy and healthy, you will need to keep his cage nice and clean. Once per week you should also perform a deep cleaning on your hamster’s cage. Remove everything from your hamster’s cage (including your hamster) and scrub the sides and bottom with warm, soapy water. Then rinse and dry the cage before putting in new bedding, your hamster’s accessories, and your hamster. In addition to a weekly deep clean, you should also do the following every day:  Remove and replace any soiled or damp bedding. Remove and dispose of droppings. Check the corners of your hamster’s cage for hidden food. Hamsters have a tendency to stash food for later. It will take some time and patience before your hamster is ready to let you hold him. Build up his trust in you by allowing him to sniff your hand and even give you a little nibble. You can also offer your hamster a treat from your hand to build up his trust in you. Once your hamster is comfortable with you, you can try to pick him up. To pick up your hamster, gently cup both hands around him and lift him slowly out of his cage. Do not swoop in and grab him or you will startle him and cause him to hide from you. Hamsters also need time outside of their cages to be happy. Once you have established trust with your hamster, take him out of his cage once per day for a little supervised playtime outside of his cage.  Make sure to keep him in a room where you can monitor his movement. Otherwise he might hide somewhere and make it difficult for you to find him. Make sure that there are no hazards in the area, such as electrical cords, that your hamster might gnaw on. A healthy hamster will be much happier than an unhealthy hamster. If a hamster is well cared for, it may live to be 1-2 years old. Take your hamster for regular check-ups with the veterinarian to make sure that he stays healthy and happy.  An unhealthy hamster may have a variety of symptoms, such as dull-looking eyes, matted fur, weight loss, shaking, runny nose and diarrhea. If your hamster is sick, take him to see a veterinarian right away. Hamsters can catch the common cold from humans. If you are sick, avoid holding your hamster until you are well again so that you don’t make him sick.

Lyra Belacqua, an orphan raised in a college in Oxford, England, and her dÃ¦mon Pantalaimon (Pan) witness a Magisterium agent poison her uncle's bottle of Tokay.

The plot then splits into two parallel universes, the other detailing what would have happened had she caught that train. In the timeline in which she boards the train, Helen sits alongside James (John Hannah) (the man in the lift) on the Underground and they strike up a conversation. She gets home in time to catch her boyfriend, Gerry (John Lynch), in bed with his American ex-girlfriend, Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Helen dumps him and moves in with her friend Anna (Zara Turner), and changes her appearance to make a fresh start. James continues to serendipitously pop into Helen's life, cheering her up and encouraging her to start her own public relations firm. She and James fall in love despite her reservations about beginning another relationship so soon after her ugly breakup with Gerry. Eventually, Helen discovers that she is pregnant. Believing it is James' child, she goes to see him at his office. She is stunned to learn from James' secretary that he is married. Upset, she disappears. James finds her on a bridge and explains that he was married but is now separated and planning a divorce. He and his soon-to-be-ex-wife maintain the appearance of a happy marriage for the sake of his sick mother. After she and James declare their love, Helen walks out into the road and is hit by a van. In the timeline in which Helen misses the train, subsequent services are delayed; she exits the station and hails a taxi. A man tries to snatch her handbag and injures her, so she goes to hospital. She arrives home after Lydia has left and remains oblivious to Gerry's infidelity. Unable to find another PR job, she takes two part-time jobs to pay the bills. Gerry continues to juggle the two women in his life. Lydia, wanting Gerry for herself, makes increasingly aggressive attempts to torment...

Keywords: Flames, Smoke. Sentence 2: A raging house fire. Keywords: Raging, House fire. Step 2: Compare the key components to assess whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Analysis: - The first sentence states the presence of flames and smoke. - The second sentence describes a raging house fire, which implies the presence of flames, and likely smoke. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. While both sentences involve flames and potentially smoke, they differ in their contexts. The first sentence generically refers to flames and smoke, but it does not provide any specific details on where these flames and smoke are located or the severity of the situation. On the other hand, the second sentence specifically refers to a raging house fire, which implies significant severity and a specific environment - a house. Conclusion: The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as the first sentence does not provide enough context or information to guarantee that it is referring to a raging house fire. Although the presence of flames and smoke in both sentences suggests a connection between the two, the specifics of the situation and context are not clear enough to draw a direct entailment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: When two grade-school boys get into a fight in the park that results in one boy, Zachary Cowan, hitting the other, Ethan Longstreet, in the face with a stick, their parents meet in a Brooklyn apartment to discuss the matter. Zachary's parents, Alan and Nancy Cowan, visit the home of Michael and Penelope Longstreet, Ethan's parents. Their meeting is initially intended to be short, but due to various circumstances, the conversation continues to draw out. In fact, Alan and Nancy begin to leave the apartment on two occasions, but are drawn back in to further discussion. At first, the couples are friendly to each other, but their respective comments start to hurt feelings, making everyone argue with one another. Apart from fighting among themselves, the couples blame each other about who is responsible for the fight between their sons. Nancy calls the Longstreets \\"superficially fair-minded\\" and Penelope and Michael complain about Alan's arrogant and dull attitude. Everyone also gets irritated with Alan when he accepts endless business phone calls on his BlackBerry, interrupting the discussion, and showing he has more interest in his business problems than the matter at hand. Michael also receives many phone calls from his ailing mother, to his frustration. Nancy accuses Michael of being a murderer because he, annoyed by the constant noise it made during the night, had earlier turned his daughter Courtney's pet hamster loose in the street. Penelope becomes emotional about the hamster and with everyone arguing with each other. Other issues include a risky drug Alan is working to defend and Michael's mother has been prescribed, and the question of idealism and responsibility that is part of Penelope's current work. contains an answer for the question: Who's parents meet in a Brooklyn apartment?, what is it ? A:","output":"The parents who meet in a Brooklyn apartment, as depicted in the article, are the parents of two grade-school boys, Zachary Cowan and Ethan Longstreet, who have had an altercation in the park. Zachary Cowan's parents are Alan and Nancy Cowan, and Ethan Longstreet's parents are Michael and Penelope Longstreet. Alan and Nancy Cowan visit the apartment of Michael and Penelope Longstreet to have a discussion about the incident involving their sons. The initial plan was for this meeting to be brief, but various circumstances led to extended conversations. Despite their attempts to leave the apartment on two occasions, Alan and Nancy Cowan found themselves pulled back into further discussions. Initially, both sets of parents were friendly towards each other, but as the discussion continued, it became heated and led to hurt feelings and arguments. These disagreements weren't just limited to the couples – they also extended to blaming each other for the fight their sons were involved in. Strains rose as Nancy Cowan criticized the Longstreets as being \\"superficially fair-minded,\\" and the Longstreets expressed discontent about Alan Cowan's self-assured and indifferent behavior.  The situation was further complicated by constant interruptions due to Alan's business phone calls on his BlackBerry, showing his seemingly greater concern for his work than for the issue at hand. Similarly, Michael Longstreet also received incessant calls from his sickly mother, adding on to the frustration and tension. Michael was even accused by Nancy Cowan of being a murderer for losing his daughter Courtney's pet hamster, since he had let it loose on the street due to its constant noises irritating him. Penelope Longstreet reacted emotionally to this revelation, increasing the strain of the meeting.  In the midst of dealing with their sons' altercation, other serious issues also came up, including a controversial drug that Alan was defending, that coincidentally was prescribed to Michael's mother, and Penelope's present dealings with the themes of idealism and responsibility.  In summary, the parents who met in a Brooklyn apartment were Alan and Nancy Cowan, parents of Zachary Cowan, and Michael and Penelope Longstreet, parents of Ethan Longstreet.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: what can get a prisoner in more trouble? Possible A: dream of freedom, attempt to escape, do time, fast for days, scape jail  Why is \\"attempt to escape\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Attempt to escape\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly involves an action that is against the rules and regulations of the prison system. To justify this choice step-by-step: 1. In a prison environment, the primary objective of the authorities is to maintain order, security, and control over the inmates. Any action that jeopardizes this objective can result in severe consequences for the prisoners. 2. Among the provided options, \\"dream of freedom\\" is a personal thought, and while it may motivate a prisoner, it doesn't have an immediate impact on the prison's order and security. Therefore, it won't result in more trouble. 3. \\"Do time\\" refers to serving the sentence imposed by the criminal justice system. This is what prisoners are supposed to do, so it doesn't add more trouble than what they're already facing. 4. \\"Fast for days\\" refers to abstaining from eating for a certain period. While this may impact the prisoner's health, it doesn't threaten the prison's order or security, as it's not an act of defiance or a means of escape. Thus, it doesn't fit the criteria of causing more trouble. 5. \\"Scape jail\\" appears to be a typo. However, if it was intended to be \\"escape jail,\\" it would essentially be the same as \\"attempt to escape.\\" 6. \\"Attempt to escape\\" directly undermines the main objective of the prison system. Escaping or attempting to escape is a serious offense. It compromises the order, security, and control of the prison. This act is typically met with harsh punishment to deter other inmates from trying the same. So, \\"attempt to escape\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it involves a conduct that actively disrupts the established system and is typically met with harsh punishment, hence putting the prisoner in more trouble."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During their visit, Barbara is attacked by a zombie. Her brother comes to her defense but is killed. Barbara flees the cemetery and discovers what at first seems to be an abandoned farmhouse. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows. They discover other survivors who have been hiding in the cellar of the house: Harry Cooper, a loud and argumentative husband; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; teenager Tom Bitner and his girlfriend Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility.

Article: A new plan for getting children to and from school is being started by the education authorities in part of Eastern England. This could end the worries of many parents fearful for their children's safety on the roads. Until now the Country Council has only been prepared to provide bus services for children living more than three miles from their school, or sometimes less if special reasons existed. Now it has been decided that if a group of parents ask for help in organizing transport they will be prepared to go ahead, provided the arrangement will not lose money and that children taking part will be attending their nearest school. The new scheme is to be tried out this term for children living at Milton who attend Impington school. The children live just within the three-mile limit and the Council has said in the past it will not undertake to provide free transport to the school. But now they have agreed to organize a bus service from Milton to Impington and back, a plan which has the support of the school's headmaster. Between 50 and 60 parents have said they would like their children to take part. Final calculations have still to be carried out, but a council official has said the cost to parents should be less than PS6. 50 a term. They have been able to arrange the service at a low cost because there is already an agreement with the bus company for a bus to take children who live further away to Impington. The same bus would now just make an extra journey to pick up the Milton children. The official said they would get in touch with other groups of parents who in the past had asked if transport could be provided for their children, to see if they would like to take part in the new scheme.

Glass cups are better than plastic cups because the  Select from:  a). glass cups are weaker and flimsier.;  b). plastic cups are weaker and flimsier.;","output":"b). plastic cups are weaker and flimsier.  Jeremy had always been an advocate for glass cups, claiming that they were far superior to their plastic counterparts. His friends often rolled their eyes whenever he proclaimed this, but he was undeterred. In Jeremy's mind, the conclusion was clear: glass cups had a certain elegance and durability that could not be matched by plastic. One afternoon, Jeremy hosted a small gathering of friends at his apartment. Each guest was immediately handed a glass cup as they walked through the door, much to their bemusement. Sensing their skepticism, Jeremy used this as an opportunity to demonstrate the superiority of glass over plastic. \\"You see,\\" he began, \\"glass cups are simply better than plastic cups because plastic cups are weaker and flimsier.\\" He quickly took out a plastic cup from his cupboard to illustrate his point. Placing both a glass cup and the plastic cup on the table, he encouraged his friends to closely inspect them. As his friends eagerly inspected both cups, Jeremy continued to explain his reasoning. \\"Firstly, glass cups maintain their shape and integrity better than plastic cups. Over time, plastic cups can warp and bend, leading to spills and an unpleasant drinking experience. Moreover, plastic cups are more prone to leaks, as they can crack or develop small holes under stress.\\" He also pointed out the environmental benefits of using glass cups. \\"Glass is a more sustainable option in the long run. It can be endlessly recycled without losing its quality, whereas plastic can only be recycled a limited number of times, eventually ending up in landfills or polluting our oceans.\\" Finally, Jeremy addressed the aesthetic appeal of glass cups, emphasizing that they simply look more elegant and sophisticated. \\"Glass cups provide a sense of refinement and class that can elevate any occasion - be it a formal dinner or a casual get-together.\\" By the end of his impassioned speech, Jeremy's friends were convinced of the merits of glass over plastic cups, and they spent the rest of the evening clinking their glasses together in toasts to the environment, durability, and elegance. Jeremy knew that his preference for glass cups might not change the world overnight, but he could at least start by changing the minds of those closest to him. Through small actions such as using and promoting glass cups over plastic ones, he believed positive change could begin, one glass at a time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A prime integer is an integer that is only divisible by '1' and itself. The output should be the list of prime numbers in the input list. If there are no primes in the input list an empty list (\\"[]\\") should be returned. Q: [883, 535] A:","output":"Step 1: Identify the given list of integers The given list of integers is [883, 535]. Step 2: Define the is_prime function To determine if a number is prime or not, create a function 'is_prime' that takes an integer as input and returns True if the input is prime, otherwise returns False. The function will work as follows:   a. If the number is less than 2, return False (as 0, 1, and negative numbers are not prime)   b. Iterate through a range starting from 2 up to the square root of the input number (inclusive), and for each number in this range, check if the input number is divisible by this number.   c. If the input number is divisible by any number in the range, return False, else return True. Step 3: Filter prime numbers from the input list Use the 'is_prime' function to filter out non-prime numbers from the input list. Create an empty list called 'prime_numbers'. Iterate through the input list, and for each number, check if the 'is_prime' function returns True. If true, append the number to the 'prime_numbers' list. Step 4: Return the resulting list of prime numbers At the end of the iteration, return the 'prime_numbers' list.

He has pledged no \\"gimmicks\\" but newspaper reports have suggested he is considering tax cuts and could have as much as £5bn for a pre-election \\"giveaway\\". Pre-election Budgets are invariably controversial with many entering political folklore, although former Chancellor Ken Clarke has claimed that no Budgets \\"in living memory\\" have changed the outcome of a subsequent election. How have some of Mr Osborne's predecessors dealt with the twin pressures of securing the nation's finances while trying to deliver their party an election victory? 2010: Alistair Darling (24 March) What was announced: In the run-up to his third Budget, Mr Darling ruled out any pre-election giveaways, saying his package would be \\"sensible and workmanlike\\". With the UK having recently emerged from recession and with the annual budget deficit running well in excess of £150bn, Mr Darling said his priorities were to get borrowing down and secure the economic recovery. He announced plans for a number of tax rises on the better-off, saying he would curb personal tax allowances for those earning more than £150,000. With one eye on May's election, he vowed to phase in planned rises in fuel duty, promised an extra £600m for winter fuel allowance and offered to suspend stamp duty on home purchases by first-time buyers of up to £250,000. Among the more eye-catching proposals was a planned 10% rise in duty on cider. There was no increase in VAT despite speculation in advance that it had been considered and rumours of a disagreement between Mr Darling and then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. What happened next? Mr Darling stood down as chancellor five days after the general election when the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition government, although he remained as shadow chancellor for a further five months. In his \\"emergency\\" Budget in June, the new chancellor George Osborne reversed some of his predecessor's measures, including the 10% tax on cider - although Labour had already effectively ditched the plan due to opposition. However some other measures in Mr Darling's Budget - including a four-year freeze on inheritance tax thresholds - survived the change of government. Mr Osborne also chose not to reverse a rise in the top rate of tax from 40p to 50p, announced by Mr Darling in 2009 but which only came into force in April 2010. The main announcement in Mr Osborne's first Budget was a rise in VAT from 17.5% to 20%, something Labour had flirted with but decided against a few months earlier. 1996: Ken Clarke (26 November) What was announced: Although the 1997 general election was held in May, the Conservatives - trailing Labour badly in the polls at the time - opted to announce their final Budget nearly six months earlier, at the end of November 1996. In his speech, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said the UK was experiencing a \\"Rolls-Royce recovery - built to last\\" and predicted economic growth of 3.5% in 1997. He cut the basic level of income tax from 24p to 23p and raised inheritance tax thresholds to £215,000. Mr Clarke, the last Chancellor to sip alcohol during his Budget address, reduced duty on spirits but announced a 40% increase on tax on so-called alcopops. What happened next? Following Labour's landslide, Mr Clarke stood for Conservative leader but was defeated by William Hague and had returned to the backbenches by the time Gordon Brown delivered his first Budget in July 1997. Labour had already said it would stick to Conservative spending plans for the first two years and it left a number of other measures in Mr Clarke's final Budget untouched. However, Mr Brown increased tobacco duties by 2p on top of what the Conservatives had done and announced an inflation-linked rise in alcohol duties pending a review of taxation on the industry. Mr Brown also outlined plans to introduce a 10p \\"starting rate\\" of tax on incomes - which took effect in 1999 - and, in the most headline-grabbing move, confirmed the long-trailed £3.5bn windfall tax on the profits of the privatised utilities. 1992: Norman Lamont (11 March) What was announced: Norman Lamont delivered his second Budget as chancellor on 11 March, less than six weeks before the general election. Branding it as a \\"Budget for recovery\\" after the 1990-1991 recession, Mr Lamont announced a £2bn tax giveaway, halving the sales tax on new cars, cutting betting duty and introducing a new 20% income tax band on the first £2,000 of taxable income. Labour attacked the package as a \\"panic-stricken pre-election sweetener\\" while some economists questioned the lack of action to reduce double-digit interest rates. What happened afterwards: The Conservatives narrowly won the 1992 election but Mr Lamont's joy was short-lived as the UK crashed out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and interest rates rose briefly to 15%. The government's reputation was tarnished by the debacle but Mr Lamont survived to deliver the next Budget in March 1993, where he began a major fiscal consolidation to deal with rising deficit levels. Mr Lamont' decision to introduce VAT on domestic fuel bills - initially at 8% but rising to 17.5% - was attacked as \\"shameful\\" by Labour which said it directly contradicted election promises. He was replaced as chancellor by Ken Clarke two months later and although the economy bounced back the party lost heavily in 1997. 1987: Nigel Lawson (17 March) What was announced: His Budget speech may have been the shortest for more than 100 years but Nigel Lawson's package - delivered weeks before the general election - was one of the most political of the Thatcher era. The Budget contained across-the-board tax cuts worth billions. In what Labour described as a \\"bribes Budget\\", Mr Lawson cut the basic rate of income tax by 2% to 27%, froze excise duties, abolished the tax on on-course betting, cut the duty on unleaded petrol and further reduced so-called \\"death duties\\". What happened next? The Conservatives were comfortably re-elected, albeit with a smaller majority than four years earlier. A year later, Nigel Lawson continued his tax-cutting push, cutting the basic rate of income tax to 25% and increasing personal tax allowances by double the rate of inflation - moves which critics said helped contribute to the inflationary boom which followed. 1979: Denis Healey (April 3) What was announced: Known as the \\"caretaker Budget\\", it came shortly after Labour government lost a vote of confidence in the House of Commons, triggering an election. Prime Minister Jim Callaghan still had to keep the business of government going and Chancellor Denis Healey's statement was designed to ensure taxes continued to be raised until a new administration was elected. Mr Healey had limited room for manoeuvre politically and economically, significant net tax cuts having been agreed the year before, and critics said the whole episode was little more a Finance Bill in disguise. Although child benefit was increased, Labour MPs complained the Budget, which was framed with the co-operation of the Conservatives, was not political enough. What happened next? After Labour's defeat, the new Conservative government delivered an emergency Budget in June, marking a major change in economic direction. Chancellor Geoffrey Howe raised VAT from 12.5% - on luxury items - and 8% on most other goods to a single rate of 15%, a move strongly criticised by Labour. The basic rate of income tax was cut from 33% to 30% and the top rate was reduced from 83% to 60% on \\"earned income\\". 1970: Roy Jenkins (April 15) What was announced: Labour Chancellor Roy Jenkins pledged a \\"modest stimulus\\" to an economy that was still recovering from the devaluation of sterling three years earlier. New tax reliefs worth £220m were announced as was a cut in interest rates to 7%. But by proceeding, in his words, \\"fairly cautiously\\", Jenkins incurred the wrath of some Labour MPs who believed the Budget was not generous enough while the package was labelled in the media as a \\"non-election\\" Budget. What happened next: Labour surprisingly lost the election to the Conservatives. In the 1971 Budget new Chancellor Anthony Barber announced a new value added tax (VAT) would come into force in 1973.

Pill-popper: German dictator Adolf Hitler allegedly was a manic depressive with Parkinson¿s, had deformed genitals, had no libido and devoured a cocktail of drugs. Adolf Hitler was a drug-abusing hypochondriac with deformed genitals who regularly consumed a cocktail of amphetamines, bull semen, rat poison and morphine when he sent millions of innocent people to their death. That's according to a new explosive TV documentary based on recently-discovered records and letters from the Nazi leader's obese personal physician, Dr Theodore Morell. In a desperate attempt to show his followers he was the epitome of male virility, the 5ft 8ins German leader downed more than 80 different drugs each day - a shocking habit that some psychiatrists and. historians believe turned an  egomaniac into a sadistic mass murderer. According to National Geographic's Nazi Underworld - Hitler's Drug Use Revealed, psychiatrist Professor Nassir Ghaemi claims Hitler's drug abuse exacerbated his manic depression, reducing him to a feeble, trembling figure. 'It’s not whether. Hitler was an amphetamine addict or not – it’s that Hitler had bipolar. disorder and amphetamines made it worse,' he said. 'That. is the issue. That has never been described before and that would. explain a lot why Hitler changed in the late 1930s and the 1940s.' According to the Irish Mirror, a series of letters and medical reports on Hitler commissioned by the U.S. military after the war were released in America, among them interviews with the Fuhrer's six doctors including Morell. The 47-page classified report stated Hitler had chronic eczema, persistent stomach cramps and appalling flatulence. No-one was able to cure the leader's afflictions - until Morell prescribed live bacteria which eased the cramps. A delighted Hitler made Morell his personal physician for nine years, even though his aides called the 'Reichsmaster of injections' a 'quack', 'phony' and 'charlatan'. The. reports show Hitler snorted powdered cocaine to 'clear his sinuses. and soothe his throat' and used eye-drops infused with 10 per cent cocaine. His dosage was lowered when he began to 'crave' the illicit drug. In his drug cabinet, the controversial doctor kept gun-cleaning oil which had been banned from human consumption and. flatulence pills made from rat poison. Morell's methods were so controversial, other doctors believed he was a 'double agent' trying to poison Hitler who was experiencing 'rapid double cycling'. 'Some of his American interrogators. wondered whether he was a double agent, trying to make Hitler so. dysfunctional that he couldn’t win, couldn’t achieve what he wanted,' Ghaemi said. Mis-medication? Hitler's physician Dr Theodore Morell ¿ dubbed the ¿Reichsmaster of injections¿ by Nazis - allegedly prescribed the Fuhrer a cocktail of drugs. Addict: Recently-discovered records and letters from his physician reveal Hitler was prescribed a cocktail of more than 80 different drugs. The report also state Morell injected Hitler with extracts from the. prostate glands or ground testicles of young bulls to boost his libido so he could keep up with his much-younger lover. 'Morell gave Hitler a. preparation called Testoviron, a kind of testosterone preparation,. usually before Hitler was going to spend a night with Eva Braun,' Cambridge. University historian Richard Evans said. 'Eva. Braun was young and much fitter. Hitler was much older, he was lazy, he. didn’t take much exercise and I’m sure he asked Dr Morell to help. him out before he went to bed with Braun.” Morell’s. notes also reveal the dictator feared cancer and was paranoid about catching the common cold. Morell. treated Hitler throughout the war even though other Nazi doctors. blamed him for the dictator’s dramatic deterioration and hyperactive gabbling. The Irish Mirror reports the doctor confessed to administering opiates, morphine,. barbiturates and amphetamines when he was captured by the Allies and accused of criminal. negligence. The revelations have led some historians to speculate whether Hitler's extreme and erratic war-mongering was influenced by his drug addiction. However others fear the claims feed Hitler excusers and. neo-Nazis. 'Just 48. hours before his death Hitler dictated his will, as lucid and alert as. ever. His mental capabilities were normal,' Hans-Joachim. Neumann, author of Was Hitler Ill?, said. 'The Jews were not wiped out because Hitler was ill, but because. most Germans followed his decisions. Hitler always knew what he was. doing.' Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. Adolf Hitler allegedly suffered from manic depression, Parkinson's, and had deformed genitals. 2.

Great until now\\" A:","output":"To determine the star-rating for the given review, it's essential to analyze the comment and weigh the positive and negative aspects mentioned. Let's break down the review to understand the reviewer's perspective better: 1. The user mentioned that the product \\"used to work great,\\" which is a positive statement. 2. However, the user now reports a recent issue where they are \\"unable to start tor,\\" indicating dissatisfaction with the product. 3. Finally, the user acknowledges the previous positive experience with the phrase \\"great until now.\\" Based on this analysis, the user has had a positive experience with the product in the past but is currently experiencing issues that have prevented them from utilizing the service as expected. This conflicting perspective suggests that the appropriate star-rating should strike a balance between the previous positive experience and the current negative experience. A ★ or ★★ rating would signify a largely negative experience, which is not entirely accurate since the reviewer acknowledged that the product had been great in the past. A ★★★★★ rating would indicate a nearly flawless product, which is also not accurate, as the user is currently experiencing issues. Considering the balance of both positive and negative aspects in the review, a ★★★ or ★★★★ rating seems to be the most suitable. A ★★★ rating might lean a bit more towards acknowledging the current problem while still giving credit to the past positive experience. On the other hand, a ★★★★ rating would show a more favorable view that still accounts for the present issue.

Plot Outline: Luca, a tech-savvy private detective, is tipped off by an anonymous underworld informant about a planned hit on Mickey, the reformed mob leader turned charity activist. As Luca works around the clock to protect Mickey and find out who's behind the planned assassination, he becomes embroiled in a dense web of lies, betrayal, and loyalties tested to the brink. All the while, the shadowy figure of the informant serves as a complex presence, manipulating events in ways no one can foresee.  Plot: The movie begins with the mysterious informant contacting Luca through a secure messaging app, known for its use within the criminal underworld. Luca has spent years trying to bring down criminal gangs, and thereby developed a reputation as a go-to guy for people willing to share valuable information. While initially skeptical, Luca decides to check out the informant's tip. He investigates the digital footprint of the rumored assassination plot on Mickey, a man who once commanded a notorious crime syndicate before turning his back on the gang and dedicating his life to charitable work. As Luca delves deeper into the case, he discovers a dangerous feud simmering within the criminal underworld between Mickey's old gang and a new, more aggressive faction. The latter faction, led by a ruthless and ambitious crime lord named Victor, wants Mickey out of the picture, fearing he knows too much and can act as key witness should the authorities go after Victor.  Luca meets Mickey to inform him about the hit and offers his protection. Grateful for the warning but sensing the gravity of the situation, Mickey decides to take action against Victor, enlisting two of his most trusted former enforcers, Frank and Max, to take down the new criminal empire. Under Luca's watchful eye, Mickey's three-man team tracks down Victor's network, digging through the investments, money laundering, and bribery ring that have contributed to Victor's expanding influence. As they piece together the puzzle, they find a portrait of a ruthless, cruel man with little loyalty even within his own ranks. Meanwhile, Luca finds himself drawn further into the informant's web. As the informant's information leads to a succession of raids against Victor's empire, Luca starts to explore the informant's motivations. Why would someone with such detailed knowledge of the criminal underworld attempt to destroy it from within? As the film reaches its climax, Luca discovers the shocking truth: the informant is actually Victor's own right-hand man, Alex. Driven by his distaste for Victor's murderous excesses, and by deep-rooted bitterness for Victor’s violent methods, Alex has been quietly plotting his boss's downfall and Mickey's survival. Fearing exposure, Alex's life hangs in the balance as the house of cards around Victor starts to crumble. In the final confrontation, Victor and his loyalists corner Luca, Mickey, Frank, Max, and Alex in an abandoned warehouse. A pulse-pounding shootout ensues, resulting in the deaths of Frank and Max. Just as all seems lost, the police storm the warehouse, tipped off by one last cryptic message from Alex. Injured and outgunned, Victor flees the scene, only to be run down by Alex in a dramatic car chase, culminating in a nail-biting stand-off. Alex kills Victor just seconds before the police apprehend them both, while Luca and Mickey watch on. In the aftermath, Mickey decides to go into hiding indefinitely under a new identity, grateful to Luca for saving him from the hit and to Alex for unknowingly putting him on the case. Alex takes a plea deal and agrees to testify against the remnants of Victor's crime empire, hoping to make amends for his past life.  Luca finds himself haunted by the whirlwind of betrayal, loyalty, and redemption that he has witnessed, his faith in the power of human change both strengthened and shaken. As the informant's dark web finally unravels, Luca's fight for justice and the quest to unmask the shadows hiding within the criminal underworld continues.

Vice Minister of Health Gao Qiang told reporters in Beijing that the \\"public health care system in China is insufficient.\\" The Vice Minister of Health also suggested that the government would pick up the costs of care to earthquake victims, many of whom have little or no insurance: \\"The government should be responsible for providing medical treatment to them,\\" he said.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Gao Qiang is of Chinese nationality.  The context provided offers significant information to deduce the nationality of Gao Qiang. The discussion primarily revolves around the earthquake that struck an area in China, which has been mostly overlooked in terms of the country's economic growth. It mentions the province of Sichuan, an inland region in China, indicating that the topic concerns Chinese matters. Furthermore, the quote provided is from Gao Qiang, who holds the position of Vice Minister of Health, addressing reporters in Beijing – the capital city of China. Another crucial piece of information from the context is the statement made by Gao Qiang, which reveals the challenges related to public health care in China and the government's responsibility to provide medical treatment to earthquake victims. Therefore, it is highly likely that Gao Qiang's role pertains specifically to the Chinese government, making it reasonable to conclude that his nationality is indeed Chinese. In summary, considering the contextual information revolving around the earthquake in China, the mention of Sichuan province, Gao Qiang's position as Vice Minister of Health, and his address to reporters in Beijing, it can be confidently inferred that Gao Qiang is of Chinese nationality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who claims to own a painting from Van Gogh?, using the article: Professor John Oldman is packing his belongings onto his truck, preparing to move to a new home. His colleagues show up to give him an impromptu farewell party: Harry, a biologist; Edith, an art history professor and devout Christian; Dan, an anthropologist; Sandy, a historian who is in love with John; Art, an archaeologist; and his student Linda. As John's colleagues press him to explain the reason for his departure, he picks up from a reference to Magdalenian cultures by Dan and slowly, and somewhat reluctantly, reveals that he is a prehistoric caveman himself from that precise period. He states that he has lived for more than 14 millennia, and that he relocates every ten years to keep others from realizing that he does not age. He begins his tale under the guise of a possible science-fiction story, but eventually stops speaking in hypotheticals and begins answering questions from a first-person perspective. His colleagues refuse to believe his story but accept it as a working hypothesis in order to glean his true intentions. John relates he was a Sumerian for 2000 years, later a Babylonian, and eventually went East to become a disciple of Buddha. He claims to have had a chance to sail with Columbus (admitting that at the time he still believed the earth was flat) and to have befriended Van Gogh (one of whose original paintings he apparently owns, a gift from the artist himself)., what would be the answer ?

However, there are a few improvements that can be made for better code readability and maintainability. Here are some suggestions: 1. Separate the CSS code into a separate style sheet rather than including it within the HTML file. This will make the code more organized and easier to maintain. 2. Use semantic HTML tags for better readability and accessibility. For example, replace the \`div\` elements with appropriate semantic tags like \`section\` or \`article\`. 3. Encapsulate the JavaScript code within a JavaScript file and include it using the \`<script>\` tag, rather than embedding it directly in the HTML file. 4. Use consistent indentation for better readability. The current code has inconsistent indentation, making it harder to understand the structure. 5. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section of the code. This will make it easier for other developers (and future you) to understand the code logic. 6. Consider refactoring the functions to use more descriptive function and variable names. This will make the code self-explanatory and easier to understand. 7. Validate user inputs and handle errors gracefully. For example, check if the generated prime numbers are distinct and handle potential division by zero errors or undefined behavior. By implementing these suggestions, the code will adhere to standards in semantics, improve readability, and enhance maintainability."},{"instruction":"well, to overall \\"RSA Encryption Algorithm Visualization\\". how accurately javascript and ui output performs?","output":"The JavaScript implementation of the RSA Encryption Algorithm in the provided code appears to be accurate and functional. It follows the standard steps of key generation, encryption, and decryption using modular exponentiation, which is the core mathematical operation in RSA. Regarding the UI output, the code dynamically generates prime numbers, calculates various RSA parameters, and displays them on the page. It then performs encryption and decryption on a randomly generated message, displaying the results. Based on a visual inspection of the code, it seems that the UI output accurately reflects the encryption and decryption process. However, a thorough testing and validation process is necessary to ensure the correctness and accuracy of the implementation. It is recommended to test the code with various inputs, including different prime numbers and messages, to verify its functionality. Additionally, implementing unit tests and conducting a code review by other developers can provide a more comprehensive assessment of the code's accuracy and reliability. Remember, cryptography is a complex field, and it is crucial to ensure a solid implementation and follow best practices to guarantee the security and effectiveness of the encryption algorithm."},{"instruction":"need to add a more comprehensible model to overall understanding of how things working. I don't know what else to add here...","output":"To provide a more comprehensible model of how the RSA Encryption Algorithm works, you can add step-by-step explanations of each phase of the algorithm and highlight the underlying mathematical concepts involved. Here's a suggested model: 1. Key Generation: - Select two distinct prime numbers, p and q. - Calculate n by multiplying p and q: n = p * q. - Calculate Euler's totient function of n: φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1). - Select a public exponent e that is relatively prime to φ(n). - Calculate the private exponent d, satisfying (d * e) % φ(n) = 1. 2. Encryption: - Convert the message to be encrypted (plaintext) into a numerical representation, often using ASCII or Unicode values. - Use modular exponentiation to encrypt the numerical representation of the plaintext: - Raise the numerical representation to the power of the public exponent e. - Take the remainder when divided by the larger number n. - The encrypted message is the resulting ciphertext. 3. Decryption: - Use modular exponentiation to decrypt the ciphertext: - Raise the ciphertext to the power of the private exponent d. - Take the remainder when divided by n. - The decrypted message is the resulting plaintext in its numerical representation. - Convert the numerical representation back to the original message using ASCII or Unicode values. The inclusion of this model, together with the existing explanations and code, will help readers understand the step-by-step process of the RSA Encryption Algorithm and the underlying concepts involved, such as prime numbers, modular exponentiation, and the properties of Euler's totient function."},{"instruction":"so, basically, adding some ASCII switcher radiobutton to it? also, highlighting some key elements in text with ballooned popups descriptions is a good idea.","output":"Adding an ASCII switcher radiobutton can be a helpful addition to the visualization if you want to demonstrate how the RSA Encryption Algorithm can be applied to the numerical representation of plaintext using ASCII encoding. This will allow users to switch between encrypting and decrypting ASCII messages, providing a more interactive experience. Highlighting key elements in the text with ballooned pop-up descriptions can also be a good idea. It will help provide additional explanations or definitions for terms and concepts used in the algorithm, making it easier for users to understand the visualization. By combining the ASCII switcher radiobutton and the highlighted pop-up descriptions, users can interact with the visualization, see the algorithm in action, and gain a deeper understanding of the RSA Encryption Algorithm and how it works."},{"instruction":"now need to define key-elements in actual descriptions to target or trigger that onhover balloon with a further description, when you mousehower on highlighted words.","output":"To define key-elements in the descriptions that trigger the balloon with further descriptions on hover, you can follow these steps: 1. Identify the key elements in the descriptions that require further explanation or definitions. These could be terms or concepts specific to the RSA Encryption Algorithm, such as \\"public exponent,\\" \\"private exponent,\\" or \\"modular exponentiation.\\" 2. Wrap these key elements in HTML with appropriate markup, such as \`<span>\` tags or \`<a>\` tags, to make them easily identifiable. 3. Add event listeners, such as \`mouseover\` and \`mouseout\`, to these identified elements using JavaScript. These event listeners will trigger functions to display and hide the balloon with further descriptions. 4. Implement the functions that display and hide the balloon. You can achieve this by dynamically creating and modifying HTML elements, such as \`<div>\` or \`<span>\`, that will serve as the balloon. These functions can be triggered by the event listeners and should include the logic to position the balloon element and fill it with the appropriate description. 5. Style the balloon element using CSS to make it visually appealing and easy to read. You can consider using CSS properties like \`position\`, \`padding\`, \`border-radius\`, \`background-color\`, and \`font-size\`. By implementing these steps, you will be able to highlight key elements in the descriptions and display relevant information in a balloon on hover.

Their argument escalated, fueled by their stubborn and competitive nature. As they continued to exchange sharp words, a random street vendor caught their attention. The vendor was selling an assortment of quirky items, including a small trinket shaped like a heart. Seeing an opportunity to teach her friend a lesson, Tomo impulsively bought the heart-shaped item and declared with a smirk, \\"I wish we could switch bodies for a day!\\" Sakaki, not one to back down from a challenge, scoffed at the idea. \\"As if that incredibly silly charm could grant such a ridiculous wish!\\" she retorted dismissively. However, just as the two friends turned to walk away, the charm glowed brightly. As they looked back, they realized something unbelievable had occurred—their bodies had indeed switched! Much to their surprise and disbelief, they now found themselves in each other's bodies. The moment of realization was quickly overshadowed by curiosity. Tomo examined her new body, inspecting every detail, while Sakaki gingerly touched her own face, utterly confused. Once the initial shock subsided, the girls reluctantly accepted their new reality and decided to make the best of the situation. Tomo, now in Sakaki's body, couldn't hide her excitement. \\"This is so awesome! Now I get to experience being the most athletic and graceful girl in school!\\" she exclaimed, attempting to perform one of Sakaki's signature high jumps. Much to her chagrin, Tomo (in Sakaki's body) clumsily lost her balance and fell flat on her face. Laughter filled the room as everyone watched the spectacle. Meanwhile, Sakaki, now in Tomo's body, quietly observed her surroundings. Her usual reserved demeanor clashed with Tomo's hyperactive nature, making her feel even more out of place. However, as the day progressed, Sakaki found herself having an unexpected epiphany—despite Tomo's impulsiveness, there was an undeniable charm to her carefree, adventurous approach to life. As they spent the day in each other's bodies, they slowly gained a newfound appreciation for one another. Tomo, in Sakaki's body, learned about the quiet struggles Sakaki faced due to her perceived coolness. She began to empathize with Sakaki's longing to befriend the cats she so adored. Conversely, Sakaki, in Tomo's body, realized just how physically challenging it was to maintain Tomo's energetic persona throughout the day. When the clock struck midnight, the charm suddenly glowed once more, returning the girls to their original bodies. The experience had taught them valuable lessons about empathy, understanding, and the importance of accepting one another's differences. With a newfound sense of camaraderie, Tomo and Sakaki's friendship grew stronger, both appreciating the unique qualities they possessed. From that day forward, their arguments became less frequent, replaced with a mutual understanding that only brought them closer together. Despite the quirkiness of their Freaky Friday-esque experience, Tomo and Sakaki's story served as a reminder that true friendship transcends boundaries and allows for growth and understanding, even in the most unexpected circumstances."},{"instruction":"hu","output":"I'm sorry, but I didn't understand what you were trying to say.

To define key-elements in the descriptions that trigger the balloon with further descriptions on hover, you can follow these steps: 1. Identify the key elements in the descriptions that require further explanation or definitions. These could be terms or concepts specific to the RSA Encryption Algorithm, such as “public exponent,” “private exponent,” or “modular exponentiation.” 2. Wrap these key elements in HTML with appropriate markup, such as &lt;span&gt; tags or &lt;a&gt; tags, to make them easily identifiable. 3. Add event listeners, such as mouseover and mouseout, to these identified elements using JavaScript. These event listeners will trigger functions to display and hide the balloon with further descriptions. 4. Implement the functions that display and hide the balloon. You can achieve this by dynamically creating and modifying HTML elements, such as &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt;, that will serve as the balloon. These functions can be triggered by the event listeners and should include the logic to position the balloon element and fill it with the appropriate description. 5. Style the balloon element using CSS to make it visually appealing and easy to read.

Mac and his family are just moving to another apartment within the complex they already live in rather than moving to a whole new city as Mac elaborates on this by explaining that his mom got a promotion at work and needs a home office, so the family needs to move into a bigger place Rewrite this last part like this: Goo finally clues in at the purpose of the party, rand misunderstands that she panics thinking Mac is going away, she cries hysterically and grabs Mac in a tight hug and carries him around while running, to which Frankie replies oh yeah you forgot to say goodbye to your girlfriend, which then Frankie begins to cry hysterically and decries how fate is cruel to separate two young lovers, only after Mac clears the misunderstanding with the help of Mr. Herriman who is the only one that knows the situation that Mac isn’t moving, they stop except for Goo who doesn’t put Mac down and misunderstands and assumes Mac is staying because her embrace made Mac fall in love with her, which Mac tries so hard to rebuff but it is too late, Goo says she will be his girlfriend which everyone else misunderstands as well as she begins to pucker up and Mac disgusted at the thought of getting kissed by Goo cries for help as the strength of her grasp is holding him he can’t move, but when she finally kisses him, he is not disgusted, and is actually moved after all, and decides to finally be honest of the crush he had denied, as Goo kisses him repeatedly, the last image is Mac’s face all flustered and smiling, as the nightmare he had about Goo carrying Mac away conjures one last time, only the thought gets smaller and smaller as the nightmare Mac’s cries for help continues and as it is about to vanish it let’s out a very squeaky NO and Help! as Mac rests his head on Goo’s, while Goo begins to speak in a fake French accent like in Mac’s nightmares, only Mac blushes instead of acting disgusted and accepts Goo.

I just thought: piracy is bad, but some games, movies, books etc., that’re available only in unofficial translations, promote piracy only by their existing in the age of the Internet, and only one method that can stop this is creating by almost all countries of the world something like the Great Firewall of China or even destroying of the global Internet and creating their own Kwangmyongs","output":"Hello! I understand your concern about piracy and the availability of unofficial translations of games, movies, books, etc. However, implementing measures like the Great Firewall of China or destroying the global Internet would have significant negative consequences on various aspects of society and freedom of information. While it may address some piracy concerns, it would also limit access to valuable resources, hinder global communication, and restrict basic online freedoms. There are alternative approaches to minimize piracy while still preserving the benefits of the Internet. Some methods include: 1. Strengthening copyright laws: Governments can work on improving copyright protection and enforcement, ensuring that creators and copyright holders are properly compensated for their work. 2. Promoting official translations: Making official translations more widely available and accessible can help reduce demand for unofficial versions. 3. Educating consumers: Raising awareness about the negative impact of piracy and the importance of supporting legitimate content can help deter individuals from engaging in piracy. 4. Digital rights management (DRM) technologies: Developers and content creators can implement effective DRM measures to protect their products from unauthorized distribution. 5. Offering affordable and convenient options: Making legal content readily available at affordable prices through platforms like streaming services, digital marketplaces, and libraries can reduce the incentive for piracy. 6. Collaborative efforts: International cooperation among governments, content producers, and technology companies can help develop strategies to combat piracy effectively. These alternative approaches aim to strike a balance between copyright protection and ensuring access to legitimate content for users."},{"instruction":"I thought about this because I played MOTHER 3","output":"I understand that playing unofficially translated versions of games like MOTHER 3 can be tempting when there is no official translation available. However, it's important to consider the potential consequences of piracy on the creators and developers of the game. In the case of games like MOTHER 3, where an official translation is not available, it can be frustrating for fans who want to enjoy the game in their preferred language. However, supporting the official release and expressing the demand for an official translation can encourage developers to consider localizing the game in the future. Piracy not only affects the livelihood of creators but also hinders their ability to fund future projects. By supporting legal channels and actively voicing your interest in official translations, you can contribute to the creation of more accessible content and potentially reduce the need for unofficial translations. Remember, respecting copyright and supporting the creators helps sustain the industry and promotes the development of more diverse and localized content."},{"instruction":"As I said before, that game promotes piracy only by its existing","output":"I apologize if I misunderstood your statement earlier. If you believe that the unavailability of an official translation for MOTHER 3 or similar games contributes to piracy, it's important to recognize that the responsibility for combating piracy lies with both the creators and consumers. While the availability of unofficial translations can be seen as a factor influencing piracy, it's essential to consider the broader context. Game developers and publishers also face challenges in localizing and bringing games to different markets due to various factors such as licensing, resources, and market demand. One possible solution is for developers and publishers to actively engage with the community and listen to their demands for official translations. By showing support and creating a demand for these localized versions, fans can encourage companies to prioritize translation efforts. Additionally, consumers can refrain from participating in piracy, even in cases where official translations are not available. By supporting legitimate channels and expressing the desire for official translations, fans can demonstrate their interest and potentially influence the decision-making of developers and publishers. Ultimately, it's a complex issue with no simple solution. Encouraging open dialogue between content creators and consumers, along with promoting respect for intellectual property rights, can help address both the demand for official translations and the issues surrounding piracy."},{"instruction":"And in result of this problem people begin to pirate other works of art and become fried pirates","output":"I understand your concern that the unavailability of official translations may contribute to people resorting to piracy for other works of art. It's important to recognize that piracy is a complex issue influenced by various factors. However, it's essential to differentiate between the reasons people choose piracy and potential solutions to address those reasons. While the availability of unofficial translations for certain works can be a contributing factor to piracy, it doesn't necessarily mean that it automatically leads to piracy across different forms of media. People's motivation to engage in piracy can vary and might stem from factors such as accessibility, affordability, or a desire to access content not readily available legally. Implementing effective solutions to reduce piracy involves a multifaceted approach that includes measures like strengthening copyright laws, improving availability and affordability of legal content, raising awareness about the negative impact of piracy, and continually engaging with consumers to understand their needs and preferences. By addressing the root causes of piracy and providing legal alternatives that meet consumer demands, it becomes possible to discourage piracy across different forms of media. Creating a more accessible and affordable ecosystem for art and entertainment can help reduce the incentive for piracy and encourage individuals to support creators and rights holders. Ultimately, it's essential for both creators and consumers to work together to find sustainable and ethical solutions that support content creators while providing consumers with the access they desire."},{"instruction":"I would make like this: if an author didn’t release a work of art officially in a country on its language, they can’t sue unofficial translators until they release it","output":"It's important to note that I am an AI language model and not a legal expert. However, I can provide some general insights on copyright and intellectual property. Copyright laws typically grant authors exclusive rights to control the distribution and translation of their works. These rights may vary depending on the country and the specific legal framework in place. In many cases, unauthorized translations may infringe upon these rights, even if the original work has not been officially released in a particular country or language. However, enforcement of copyright laws depends on various factors, including the jurisdiction, local regulations, and the actions taken by rights holders. It is conceivable that an author or rights holder may choose not to take legal action against unofficial translators if they do not intend to release the work officially in a particular market or language. Nonetheless, this does not automatically mean that unofficial translations are legal or that the author has waived their rights. It's worth noting that encouraging the respect of intellectual property rights and supporting legitimate channels can help foster creativity and ensure that artists and creators are rewarded for their work. While addressing the availability of official translations can help curb the demand for unofficial versions, it is still important to respect the rights of copyright holders. If you have specific legal questions or concerns about intellectual property, it would be advisable to consult a legal professional with expertise in copyright and international law in your jurisdiction."},{"instruction":"rewrite the text using the synonyms: secure data storage, greater opportunities for analytics, and optimization of business processes.","output":"rewrite the text using the synonyms: safe data storage, increased possibilities for analysis, and streamlining of business procedures."},{"instruction":"rewrite the text using the synonyms, keep the language clear: Innowise Group has migrated an existing on-premise solution to the cloud, building data marts and enhanced dashboards with analytics.","output":"Innowise Group has shifted a preexisting solution from on-site to the cloud, constructing data repositories and improved visual displays with analysis capabilities."},{"instruction":"rewrite the text using the synonyms, keep the language clear: Our engineers have developed data marts: Operative, HR Management, Finance, Logistics, and E-commerce data, which refers to uploading data from different sources like internal APIs, Salesforce, and Google Analytics, transforming, and loading it into the final data storage.

The adsorption rate of a phage depends on its ability to bind to specific receptors on the surface of the bacterium. These receptors are molecules that the phage recognizes and attaches to in order to infect the bacterium. If a bacterium produces a higher amount of the phage receptor, there are more binding sites available for the phages to attach to. This will increase the chances of successful adsorption and infection by the phages. Consequently, the phages will have a higher adsorption rate on those specific bacteria. However, it is important to note that the relationship between the production of phage receptors and the adsorption rate may not be linear. There may be a saturation point where increasing the amount of phage receptors does not significantly enhance the adsorption rate further. Additionally, other factors such as the concentration of phages and the competition with other phages for binding sites can also influence the adsorption rate."},{"instruction":"如何计算单原子催化剂的形成能","output":"单原子催化剂的形成能通常是通过比较吸附物种在单原子催化剂以及其他表面或物质上的吸附能来计算的。以下是一种计算方法： 1. 首先，选择一个适当的催化剂基座或其他表面作为比较对象。选择的表面应该与单原子催化剂所在的体系相似。 2. 计算吸附物种在单原子催化剂上的吸附能。这可以通过第一性原理计算方法，比如密度泛函理论(DFT)计算。需要计算吸附物种在催化剂上的总能量，包括原子间相互作用能、电子能量以及外势能等。 3. 同样地，计算吸附物种在比较对象表面上的吸附能。使用相同的计算方法，并考虑催化剂基座或表面与吸附物种之间的相互作用。 4. 根据吸附能的计算结果，计算单原子催化剂的形成能。形成能可以定义为单原子催化剂形成时，与基态原子和吸附物种之间的能量差异。 需要注意的是，计算催化剂的形成能通常需要进行大量的计算，并且取决于所选择的催化剂体系以及计算方法的准确性。因此，准确计算单原子催化剂的形成能是一个复杂而挑战性的任务，可能需要高度专业的计算能力和经验。"},{"instruction":"惠州市第一人民医院儿童内分泌专科介绍。","output":"惠州市第一人民医院儿童内分泌专科是该医院的一个重要科室，专门负责儿童内分泌相关疾病的诊断和治疗。该专科由一支经验丰富、技术过硬的医疗团队组成，他们具有扎实的理论基础和丰富的临床经验。 儿童内分泌专科始终致力于提供高质量的医疗服务，致力于儿童内分泌疾病的早期预防、诊断、治疗和康复。该专科涉及的疾病包括但不限于儿童糖尿病、生长发育障碍、性早熟、甲状腺疾病等。专科医生会根据患儿的具体情况制定个性化的诊疗方案，并注重与家长的沟通合作，共同努力治疗疾病。 儿童内分泌专科在诊疗设备和技术上也非常先进，可以进行各种常规和特殊的检测和检查，如血液生化分析、生长激素测定、甲状腺功能评估、静态和动态内分泌功能检测等。同时，专科医生还会根据患儿的需要进行营养指导和生活方式建议，提供全方位的医疗服务。 除了儿童内分泌疾病的诊治，该专科也积极参与学术研究和教育培训，为提高医疗水平、推动学科发展做出贡献。同时，专科还与其他科室紧密合作，形成多学科综合诊疗团队，提供更全面、高效的医疗服务。 总之，惠州市第一人民医院儿童内分泌专科以其专业的医疗团队、先进的设备和优质的医疗服务，为患儿提供全面的儿童内分泌相关疾病诊疗服务，旨在帮助患儿恢复健康、促进他们的健康成长。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, despite its ambitious objective, the format has faced criticism and controversy since its inception. In this critique, we will examine several key aspects of The Hundred, highlighting its drawbacks and questioning whether it truly enhances cricket. Lack of Cricketing Tradition: One of the main criticisms of The Hundred is the absence of cricketing tradition associated with established formats such as Test cricket and One Day Internationals (ODIs). These traditional formats have evolved over decades, embodying the essence of the sport with their strategic depth and numerous memorable moments. In comparison, The Hundred lacks the weight of history and seems forced, undermining the emotional connection that cricket fans have with the game. Devaluation of the Skill Set: The Hundred, with its 100-ball-per-side structure, affects the fundamental skills of bowlers and batsmen. By reducing the number of deliveries, it limits the strategy and creativity employed by bowlers, relegating their role to a mere formality. Similarly, batsmen are compelled to adopt an aggressive approach from the very beginning, stifling the patience and skill required to construct innings. Consequently, the format prioritizes quick runs over the subtleties and complexities that make cricket unique. Complex Rule Modifications: The Hundred introduces numerous rule changes to differentiate itself from existing formats. While innovation is commendable, the excessive modifications often make the game confusing and convoluted. Rule tweaks such as changing ends every 10 deliveries, restricting fielding positions, and powerplay overs deter the fluidity of the game and create a disjointed experience for both players and spectators. The focus should be on simplifying the existing format to make it more accessible, rather than introducing a completely new structure. Familiarity and Branding: Cricket fans have grown up watching and supporting their favorite teams in established domestic leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) or the Big Bash League (BBL). Introducing a new tournament, The Hundred fails to build on the familiar team identities and fan bases associated with traditional cricket. Consequently, it faces an uphill battle in creating the same level of fandom and loyalty that other established leagues enjoy. Market Saturation: The cricket calendar is already cluttered with events, with multiple formats and tournaments vying for attention throughout the year. Launching The Hundred amidst this saturation risks fatiguing cricket enthusiasts, diluting the excitement and creating an overload of cricket. Rather than expanding the game's reach, the format may inadvertently cannibalize the existing fan base and create a resistance to change. Conclusion: While The Hundred aimed to modernize and reinvent cricket, it falls short in several fundamental aspects. The format's lack of tradition, devaluation of cricket skills, complex rule modifications, and disregard for established team identities impede its potential to attract dedicated cricket lovers. Introducing change to a well-established sport is commendable, but it should be done with careful consideration of the essence of the game and the desires of its passionate fan base. Ultimately, The Hundred's attempt to revolutionize cricket is marred by its failure to strike a balance between innovation and respecting the heritage of the sport."},{"instruction":"The most important theories, ideas and research methods in Management","output":"There are several important theories, ideas, and research methods in management that have shaped the field over the years. Some of the most significant ones include: 1. Classical management theory: This theory, developed by Frederick Taylor and Henri Fayol, emphasizes the importance of scientific approaches to management and efficiency in organizational structures. It focuses on principles such as division of labor, hierarchy, and standardization. 2. Human relations theory: Proposed by Elton Mayo and his colleagues, this theory emphasizes the significance of social and psychological aspects of employees within organizations. It highlights the importance of communication, motivation, and employee satisfaction in increasing productivity. 3. Systems theory: This theory views organizations as complex systems consisting of interrelated parts. It emphasizes that organizations are influenced by their external environment and must adapt to changes. It also highlights the interconnectedness of departments and individuals within an organization. 4. Contingency theory: This theory suggests that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to management. It emphasizes that effective management practices depend on the specific situation and context. Managers need to adapt their strategies and actions based on the needs of the organization. 5. Total Quality Management (TQM): TQM focuses on continuous improvement, customer satisfaction, and employee involvement. It aims to optimize processes, eliminate defects, and enhance the overall quality of products or services. TQM emphasizes the importance of a quality-oriented culture within organizations. 6. Leadership theories: Numerous theories have been proposed to understand effective leadership styles and behaviors. These include trait theory (highlighting innate characteristics of effective leaders), behavioral theory (focusing on specific behaviors), transformational leadership (emphasizing vision and inspiration), and situational leadership (adapting leadership style to the situation). 7. Research methods: Various research methods are utilized to study management and organizational behavior. These include surveys, interviews, case studies, experiments, and statistical analysis. Researchers use these methods to gather data and study various aspects of management, such as employee behavior, decision-making, and organizational performance. These theories, ideas, and research methods have shaped the field of management by providing frameworks, insights, and tools for effective management practices. They continue to evolve and influence the field as new research and ideas emerge."},{"instruction":"一个产科医生的日常工作包括哪些内容？","output":"一个产科医生的日常工作内容包括： 1. 接待孕妇：产科医生会在诊所或医院的产科门诊接待孕妇，询问孕妇的病史和健康情况，并进行初步的体格检查。 2. 孕产咨询：产科医生会解答孕妇和其家人的问题，提供与孕期、分娩和产后相关的建议和指导。 3. 孕检：产科医生会定期进行孕妇的孕期检查，包括测量孕妇的血压、体重、腹围等参数，检测胎儿的心率和胎动情况，以及进行必要的超声波检查，以确保母婴安全。 4. 处理妊娠并发症：产科医生会对出现并发症或疾病的孕妇进行特殊处理，如高血压、妊娠糖尿病、羊水过少、胎儿发育迟缓等。 5. 分娩和产后护理：产科医生会参与孕妇的分娩过程，监测和管理分娩的进展，处理分娩的并发症，并监护产后恢复情况，尤其关注孕妇子宫收缩、出血情况，以及乳房护理和产褥期护理。 6. 孕产疾病诊断和治疗：产科医生会诊断和治疗孕妇产生的疾病，如感染、贫血、胎盘异常、胎儿窘迫等。 7. 产前教育和辅导：产科医生会为孕妇和家人提供产前教育和辅导，包括母婴保健知识、分娩方式选择、新生儿护理等。 8. 参与科研和学术交流：产科医生会参与相关科研项目和学术交流活动，分享、探讨和更新产科医学知识，提高自身专业素质。 注意：以上内容仅为常见日常工作，具体根据医生的工作环境和职责可能会有所不同，有些产科医生可能还会从事手术（如剖腹产等）或参与研究、教学等。"},{"instruction":"Ein Patient oder Patientin ruft beim Sekretr einer Arztpraxis an und soll ihren Namen sagen.

Manque de centralisation et de standardisation des données : Lorsque les informations sur les étudiants sont dispersées dans différents systèmes ou fichiers, il devient difficile de les gérer efficacement et de s'assurer de leur exactitude. Cela peut entraîner des erreurs dans les dossiers des étudiants et des difficultés lors de la recherche d'informations spécifiques. 2. Retards dans la mise à jour des dossiers : Les changements dans les parcours scolaires des étudiants, tels que les inscriptions à des matières, les changements de programme ou les réussites académiques, doivent être enregistrés rapidement et précisément. Cependant, en cas de manque d'automatisation ou de procédures inefficaces, ces mises à jour peuvent être retardées, ce qui peut avoir un impact négatif sur le suivi des progrès des élèves. 3. Manque d'accès et de contrôle des données : Il est important de garantir que seules les personnes autorisées ont accès aux dossiers des étudiants et aux informations sensibles. Cependant, il arrive souvent que les informations soient partagées avec des personnes non autorisées ou que des erreurs humaines entraînent des problèmes de confidentialité. 4. Manque de visibilité sur les progrès des étudiants : Le suivi régulier des progrès des étudiants est essentiel pour fournir une assistance et un encadrement appropriés. Lorsque les données sont mal organisées ou difficiles à interpréter, il devient difficile de suivre et d'analyser les performances des étudiants, ce qui peut entraîner un manque de soutien adapté. 5. Problèmes de communication : Une mauvaise communication entre les différentes parties prenantes, comme les étudiants, les enseignants, les administrateurs et les parents, peut entraîner des retards dans la résolution des problèmes et des malentendus. Cela peut être préjudiciable au suivi des résultats scolaires des étudiants et à la coordination des efforts pour les aider à réussir. 6. Difficultés de planification et de gestion des ressources : Pour répondre aux besoins des étudiants, il est essentiel de planifier et de gérer efficacement les ressources telles que les enseignants, les salles de classe, le matériel pédagogique, etc. Cependant, sans des informations précises et à jour, il devient difficile de prendre des décisions éclairées et d'allouer les ressources de manière optimale.

Define the geometry: - Create a rectangular waveguide structure using the built-in FDTD Builder in Lumerical. - Choose the appropriate material for the waveguide core (e.g., silicon, silicon nitride, etc.). - Set the dimensions of the waveguide (length, width, and height) according to your design requirements. 2. Design the subwavelength grating: - Add a periodic subwavelength grating to the waveguide structure using the FDTD Builder or Layout Designer. - Determine the grating period, duty cycle, and other relevant parameters. - Select the material for the grating regions (e.g., air, silicon dioxide, etc.). - Define the grating profile, whether it is symmetric or asymmetric. 3. Define the dipole cloud source: - Place a dipole source at a specific location within the waveguide structure. - Set the excitation frequency or range, polarization, and orientation according to your analysis requirements. - Adjust the dipole source power, pulse width, and other parameters as needed. 4. Set up the simulation: - Define the simulation region around the waveguide structure, ensuring enough padding to minimize edge effects. - Choose appropriate simulation settings, such as time step, frequency range, etc. - Specify the boundary conditions based on your simulation goals. 5. Run the simulation: - Launch the simulation in Lumerical FDTD Solver to calculate the transmission or reflection spectrum of the waveguide. - Monitor the dipole source response as it interacts with the subwavelength grating structure. - Analyze the field profile and transmission spectrum to observe the band diagram of the SWG waveguide. 6. Perform band structure analysis: - Use the obtained field profile and transmission spectrum data to compute and analyze the band structure of the SWG waveguide. - Extract the dispersion relation, group velocity, and other properties of interest. - Plot the band diagram by considering various parameters (e.g., wavevector, frequency) and their corresponding eigenmodes. Note: It is important to consult Lumerical's official documentation and resources for detailed information on using their software tools effectively and accurately."},{"instruction":"how can calculate neff from band structure analysis in 3D FDTD?","output":"To calculate the effective refractive index (neff) from a band structure analysis in a 3D FDTD simulation, you can follow these steps: 1. Obtain the dispersion relation: Run the FDTD simulation and analyze the band structure to obtain the dispersion relation (frequency vs. wavevector) of the waveguide mode of interest. This is typically obtained by plotting the eigenfrequencies or transmission/reflection spectra as a function of wavevector. 2. Determine the group velocity: Calculate the group velocity (vg) of the waveguide mode. This can be done by finding the slope of the dispersion curve at the desired frequency or wavevector point. The group velocity provides information about how fast the energy propagates in the waveguide. 3. Calculate the effective refractive index: The effective refractive index (neff) can be calculated using the formula: neff = c/vg where 'c' is the speed of light in vacuum and 'vg' is the group velocity determined from the dispersion relation. 4. Validate and refine the neff calculation: Ensure that the obtained neff value is accurate by cross-checking it with other methods or theoretical calculations. You can also compare it with experimental results or published literature for validation purposes. It's worth mentioning that the band structure analysis in 3D FDTD simulations may require careful considerations and suitable tools, such as Lumerical MODE Solutions software, to accurately extract the dispersion relation and calculate neff. Consult the official documentation and resources of the software for specific guidelines and procedures tailored to your simulation setup."},{"instruction":"can you give me an example script about calculation band structure of 1D SWG waveguide in 3D FDTD?","output":"Certainly!
