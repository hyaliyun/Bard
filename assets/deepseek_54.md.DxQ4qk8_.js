Thus, they pay for 18 windows: 18 times 100 = 1800 dollars.      - Combined savings: 2200 - 1800 = 400 dollars. 4. **Comparing Separate vs. Combined Purchases**:    - Total savings if purchased separately: Dave's 0 + Doug's 200 = 200.    - Savings if purchased together: 400.    - Additional savings when purchasing together: 400 - 200 = 200.

Since Yolanda walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour, the distance she has covered in 4 hours is 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles. Now, we can add the distances both have walked to find the total distance between X and Y: Distance Yolanda walked = 12 miles Distance Bob walked = 12 miles Total distance (D) = Distance Yolanda walked + Distance Bob walked D = 12 miles + 12 miles D = 24 miles Therefore, the distance between X and Y is boxed{24}  miles."},{"instruction":"Let (x) and (y) be real numbers such that ((x + 1)(y + 2) = 8).

The data set provided is 29, 32, 33, 35, 35, 40. **Step 1: Finding the Mode** The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. In our case, we observe that: - 29 appears 1 time - 32 appears 1 time - 33 appears 1 time - 35 appears 2 times - 40 appears 1 time Since 35 appears more times than any other number, the mode is 35. **Step 2: Finding the Median** The median is the middle value of a data set when it is ordered in ascending or descending order.

Since the smallest number of cubes that can fill the box is 84, we can factorize 84 to find the possible dimensions of the cubes. The prime factorization of 84 is: 84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 Now, we know the length of the box is 49 inches, which is 7 × 7, and the depth is 14 inches, which is 2 × 7.

This result follows if we can prove that point (M) lies on the line (PQ). 1. First, since (OP) is the diameter of (W_1), point (A) lies on the circle (W_1). Hence, by the definition of a diameter, (angle OAP=90^circ). Therefore, segment (PA) is tangent to the semicircle at point (A). 2.

Hence, with:    [    PA = PC quad text{and} quad QB = QD    ]    Triangles (triangle APE) and (triangle BQD) are similar triangles. Now, since (PA) and (BQ) are parallel we have:    [    angle PAB = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - angle BQD) = angle QBD    ]    Thus:    [    AE parallel BD    ] 7. This parallelism indicates that if (M) is taken as a center of homothety with ratio (frac{MA}{MB}), which maps point (B) to point (A), and line (BD) to line (AE), point (D) maps to point (E).  8.

The reflection of the focus in line n is taken as P'. What is the locus of P' as P moves along the parabola?","output":"1. **Understanding the problem context and the given parabola**: We have a parabola with its focus at ( F ) and directrix ( d  ). For any point ( P ) on the parabola, we are considering a \\"normal\\" ( n ) which is perpendicular to the tangent ( t ) at ( P ). By reflecting the focus ( F ) over ( n ), the reflected point is denoted as ( P' ). We need to determine the locus of ( P' ) as ( P ) moves along the parabola. 2. **Using known properties of parabolas**: For any point ( P ) on the parabola with tangent ( t ), the reflection of the focus ( F ) across ( t ) lies on the directrix ( d ). This implies that the perpendicular projection of ( P ) to ( d ) is equal in length to the distance from ( P ) to ( F ). Thus, reflecting ( P ) across ( t ) and then reflecting it across ( n ), we obtain ( P' ). 3. **Chain of reflections interpretation**:    - Reflecting ( F ) over ( t ) results in a point on the directrix ( d ).    - Reflecting over ( n ) leads to doubling the distance from the point of intersection with ( d ). 4. **Geometric stretch interpretation**:    - **Stretch by a factor of 2**: The locus of the point ( P' ) is achieved by a vertical stretch of the parabola by a factor of 2. 5. **Verification of resulting shape as a parabola**:    - We consider that ( P' ) results from a stretching transformation of the original parabola.    - We construct a new focus ( F' ) and directrix ( d' ) such that every point on the stretched parabola ( p' ) maintains its definition relative to ( F' ) and ( d' ). 6. **Exact transformation parameters**:    - Assume the original parabola ( p ): ( x = frac{y^2}{2k} ).    - Directrix ( x = -frac{k}{2} ). 7. **Deriving coordinates for ( P' )**:    - For ( P(x, y) ), reflect its coordinates along the transformation.    - ( V' = text{distance to directrix} = x + frac{k}{2} ).    - ( P' text{distance from the directrix} V' ) is stretched by a factor of 2:      [      V'P' = 2V'P = 2x + k      ]      Therefore,      [      x' = V'P' - frac{k}{2} = 2x + frac{k}{2}      ] 8. **Converting coordinates**:    - Given the transformation:      [      x = frac{1}{2} left(x' - frac{k}{2}right)      ]      Inserting this into the equation of the parabola:      [      x = frac{y^2}{2k}      ]      Yields the equation for ( p' ):      [      x' = frac{y'^2}{k} + frac{k}{2}      ] 9. **Validation**:    - This is indeed a parabolic equation. 10. **Conclusion** detailing the transformed parabola features:     - Vertex at ((frac{k}{2}, 0)), new parameter ( k' = frac{k}{2} ). 11. **Identifying the focus and directrix**:     - New focus ( F' left(frac{3k}{4}, 0right) ).     - New directrix ( x = frac{k}{4} ). # Conclusion:      The geometric locus of ( P' ) as ( P ) moves along the original parabola is also a parabola, with its focus and directrix determined as derived above.

We start by noting that 503 is a prime number. For any integer ( n ) ranging from 0 to 502, the fraction (frac{305n}{503}) is not an integer. This is because the numerator (305n) can't divide (503) evenly (since 503 is a prime number and does not share any factors with 305). To understand the behavior of (leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor), we observe that:  frac{305n}{503} + frac{305(503-n)}{503} = 305. This equation implies that the sum of the fractional parts of ( frac{305n}{503} ) and ( frac{305(503-n)}{503} ) is precisely 1. The only integers in this sum are the floor parts, so:  leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{305(503-n)}{503} rightrfloor = 304.  Next, we consider the sum:  sum_{n=0}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor. We note that taking the sum from ( n = 0 ) to ( 502 ) covers all the pairings:  left( leftlfloor frac{305 times 0}{503} rightrfloor, leftlfloor frac{305 times 503}{503} rightrfloor right), left( leftlfloor frac{305 times 1}{503} rightrfloor, leftlfloor frac{305 times 502}{503} rightrfloor right), ldots, left( leftlfloor frac{305 times 251}{503} rightrfloor, leftlfloor frac{305 times 252}{503} rightrfloor right).  These pairs show symmetrical contributions. We can write:  sum_{n=0}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{305 times 0}{503} rightrfloor + sum_{n=1}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor.  Since ( leftlfloor frac{305 times 0}{503} rightrfloor = 0 ), this reduces to:  sum_{n=0}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor = sum_{n=1}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor.  Next, we can pair the terms from 1 to 251 as follows:  sum_{n=1}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor = sum_{n=1}^{251} left( leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{305(503-n)}{503} rightrfloor right).  From above, we know each pair adds up to 304:  sum_{n=1}^{251} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{305(503-n)}{503} rightrfloor = 304 cdot 251.

Let’s denote the numbers on the five cards as ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ). 2. Alex (Лёша) and Dima (Дима) each take two cards without looking at their values.

Remember, the sum of two numbers is even if and only if both numbers are even or both are odd. 8.

How can Buratino determine, with two weighings on a balance scale without using weights, who made the counterfeit coin — Cat Basilio or Fox Alice?","output":"To determine whether the counterfeit coin is heavier or lighter using only two weighings, Buratino can follow these steps: 1. **Divide the Coins into Groups**:    - Divide the 15 coins into three groups of 5 coins each. Let's call these groups A, B, and C. 2. **First Weighing**:    - Weigh group A against group B. 3. **Evaluate the First Weighing**:    - There are two possible outcomes: either the scales balance or they do not. 4. **Case 1: Scales Balance**:    - If A and B balance, then groups A and B contain only real coins, and the counterfeit coin must be in group C.    - Proceed to the second weighing to determine if the counterfeit coin is heavier or lighter. 5. **Second Weighing in Case 1**:    - Take any two coins from group C and weigh them against each other.      - If the scales balance, the counterfeit coin is the remaining one and you need to know if it’s heavier or lighter.      - If the scales do not balance, the heavier or lighter coin among the two is the counterfeit, and you've now identified whether it's heavier or lighter. 6. **Case 2: Scales Do Not Balance**:    - If A and B do not balance, the counterfeit coin is in one of these two groups.      - If A is heavier than B, the counterfeit coin is either heavier in A or lighter in B.      - If A is lighter than B, the counterfeit coin is either lighter in A or heavier in B. 7. **Second Weighing in Case 2**:    - Take three coins from group A and three coins from group B, then weigh them against each other.      - If they balance, the counterfeit coin is among the three remaining coins from the groups previously not weighed and they have the opposite property from the first weighing.      - If they don’t balance, determine which side is heavy and which is light, and follow a similar logic to determine the counterfeit coin’s nature. **Conclusion**: By systematically dividing the coins and using the two weighings, Buratino can determine whether the counterfeit coin is heavier or lighter than the real ones. Therefore, Buratino can identify whether the fake coin is made by Cat Basilio (heavier) or Fox Alisa (lighter).  boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given constants m,n, the statement the equation {x^{2}}mx+n=0 has two positive roots with respect to x is the (______) of the curve of the equation m{{x}^{2}}+n{{y}^{2}}=1 is an ellipse.

Given that the total distance driven is 500 miles and there are exactly 300 right turns, we need to maximize the distance from the starting point, which is given by ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). 2. Since each right turn changes the direction, we can assume that ( a + b = 500 ) because any deviation from this would mean either ( a ) or ( b ) is smaller than it needs to be, reducing ( a^2 + b^2 ). 3. We need to maximize ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). To do this, we first maximize ( a^2 + b^2 ).

If its speed in still water is 6 km/hr and the total journey time is 27 hours, what is the distance traveled upstream?","output":"Let's denote the distance traveled upstream as D km. When the boat is traveling upstream, it is moving against the current, so its effective speed is reduced by the speed of the river. Therefore, the upstream speed of the boat is (6 - 2) km/hr = 4 km/hr. When the boat is traveling downstream, it is moving with the current, so its effective speed is increased by the speed of the river. Therefore, the downstream speed of the boat is (6 + 2) km/hr = 8 km/hr. The time taken to travel upstream is the distance divided by the upstream speed, which is D/4 hours. The time taken to travel downstream is the distance divided by the downstream speed, which is D/8 hours. The total journey time is the sum of the upstream and downstream times, which is given as 27 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation: D/4 + D/8 = 27 To solve for D, we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 8: (2D)/8 + D/8 = 27 Combine the terms on the left side: (2D + D)/8 = 27 3D/8 = 27 Now, multiply both sides by 8 to isolate D: 3D = 27 * 8 3D = 216 Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for D: D = 216 / 3 D = 72 Therefore, the distance traveled upstream is boxed{72}  km."},{"instruction":"Ringo, when grouping his marbles into bags of 8 marbles each, has 5 marbles left over.

From the above calculations:    - When (p equiv 0 pmod{5}), both (u) and (v) are congruent to 1 modulo 5.    - When (p equiv 1 pmod{5}) or (p equiv 4 pmod{5}), (u) is congruent to 0 modulo 5 (not prime), and (v) is congruent to 2 modulo 5 (prime).    - When (p equiv 2 pmod{5}) or (p equiv 3 pmod{5}), (u) is congruent to 2 modulo 5 (prime), and (v) is congruent to 0 modulo 5 (not prime). 5. Since (u) and (v) need to be prime simultaneously, the only case that satisfies this condition is when (p equiv 0 pmod{5}), and (p) must be prime. The only prime (p equiv 0 pmod{5}) is (p = 5). 6. Verify (p = 5):    [    u = 4(5)^2 + 1 = 4 cdot 25 + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101,    ]    [    v = 6(5)^2 + 1 = 6 cdot 25 + 1 = 150 + 1 = 151.    ]    Both 101 and 151 are prime numbers. # Conclusion: [ boxed{5} ]"},{"instruction":"Given points A(x_{1},f(x_{1})) and B(x_{2},f(x_{2})) are any two points on the graph of the function f(x)=2sin (omega x+varphi) (omega > 0, frac {pi}{2} < varphi < 0), and the terminal side of angle varphi passes through point P(1, sqrt {3}).

Since we're dealing with an angle between 0^circ and 90^circ, cos 50^circ is positive; thus we have: sqrt {cos^2 50^circ} = cos 50^circ. Now, looking at the numerator, we can apply an angle sum identity for sine: sin(alpha + beta) = sin alpha cos beta + cos alpha sin beta. Using alpha = 10^circ and beta = 30^circ, we get: sin(10^circ + 30^circ) = sin 10^circ cos 30^circ + cos 10^circ sin 30^circ.

The deficit at a vertex is given by (2pi) minus the sum of the face angles at that vertex. 2. **Calculating total curvature for a cube:**        For example, a cube has an angle deficit that can be calculated by considering the angles at each vertex:        - Each vertex of a cube has three right angles meeting, each contributing (frac{pi}{2}).    - The sum of the face angles at each vertex is (3 times frac{pi}{2} = frac{3pi}{2}).    - The deficit at each vertex is (2pi - frac{3pi}{2} = frac{pi}{2}).    - Since a cube has 8 vertices, the total angle deficit is (8 times frac{pi}{2} = 4pi). 3. **Analyzing the polyhedron specified in the problem:**        The polyhedron considered here is a \\"rectangular pyramid\\" with four triangular faces and one square face.

Let's calculate the curvature for each vertex:     4. **Calculating deficits for the base vertices:**        - At each base vertex of the square, there are two right angles from the square itself, and one angle is from one of the triangles.    - The angle from a triangle at the base is ( frac{pi}{2}).     - So, the sum of angles at each base vertex is ( frac{pi}{2} + frac{pi}{2} + theta ).    - Thus, the sum of angles at each base vertex is ( pi + frac{pi}{2}  =  frac{3 pi}{2} ).    - The deficit at each base vertex is ( 2pi - frac{3pi}{2} = frac{pi}{2}).    - There are four base vertices. 5. **Calculating deficits at the apex:**        - At the apex of the pyramid, the sum of the angles from each triangle meets.    - In a regular tetrahedron, this would be (pi). 6. **Summing up the total:**        - We find the deficit at the apex: (2pi - sum_{i=1}^{4} alpha_i ) but in this particular case, let’s sum.    - Total vertex deficit using 5 vertices: (1pi).

By symmetry and factorial properties, no two distinct ( k ) yield the same remainder when divided by ( p ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Since there are ( p-1 ) different binomial coefficients from ( binom{p-2}{0} ) to ( binom{p-2}{p-2} ) and each corresponds to a unique remainder when taken modulo ( p ), we conclude that there are ( p-1 ) distinct remainders.

This makes triangle DBE isosceles with BD = BE.      3. **Calculate Angles in triangle DBE**:     - Since BD is the angle bisector of angle B, angle DBE = frac{angle B}{2} = 20^circ.     - Therefore, angle BDE = 180^circ - 20^circ = 160^circ (sum of angles in triangle DBE). 4. **Angle Between Lines**:     - In triangle DBE, since angle DBE = 20^circ, it follows:     [     angle BED = 180^circ - 2 times 20^circ = 180^circ - 40^circ = 140^circ.     ] 5. **Angles triangle BEC**:     - Notice now that angle BEC = angle BEC + angle DBE = 140^circ + 20^circ = 160^circ.     - Since angle BEC = 160^circ in triangle CED:     [     angle DEC = 180^circ - angle BEC - angle BDE = 180^circ - 160^circ = 20^circ,     ]     - Notice that firm angles in segment loop needed to consider steps. 6. **Observing Cyclic Quadrilateral**:     - Note that angle BAE + angle BDE = 40^circ + 140^circ = 180^circ, which means points A, B, D, and E are concyclic (lie on a common circle). 7. **Equal Chords Implies Equal Segments**:     - In the cyclic quadrilateral ABDE:         - angle BAD = angle BED = 40^circ     - Hence chords AD = DE as they subtend equal angles at the circumference of the circle. 8. **Combining Segments**:     - Since BD = BE and DE = DA, we can combine segments:     [     BD + DA = BE + EC = BC.     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{BD + DA = BC} ]"},{"instruction":"Let ( x, y, z in mathbf{R}_{+} ) and ( x + y + z = 1 ).

We need to prove that the distances ( PP' ) and ( QQ' ) are equal. 2. **Use Sine Rule in Triangles:**    Consider the circle passing through ( C, D, ) and ( P ) which touches the line ( AB ). Since the circle touches ( AB ), the power of point ( P ) with respect to this circle is zero. This implies that the distance from ( P ) to the line ( CD ) can be expressed using the sine of the angles formed by the segments connecting ( P ) to ( C ) and ( D ).    Similarly, for the circle passing through ( A, B, ) and ( Q ) which touches the line ( CD ), the distance from ( Q ) to the line ( AB ) can be expressed using the sine of the angles formed by the segments connecting ( Q ) to ( A ) and ( B ). 3. **Express Distances Using Sine:**    [    PP' = PC sin angle PCD = PD sin angle PDC    ]    [    QQ' = QA sin angle AQD = QB sin angle BQC    ] 4. **Relate Distances to Perpendiculars:**    The distances ( PP' ) and ( QQ' ) can be related to the perpendicular distances from points ( D ) and ( B ) to the lines ( AB ) and ( CD ) respectively.

Since the total journey takes 30 minutes (0.5 hours), and he spends one third of the time at each speed, we can calculate the distance covered at each speed: 1. City driving at 28 mph for 1/3 of the time: Time = 0.5 hours / 3 = 0.1667 hours Distance = Speed * Time = 28 mph * 0.1667 hours = 4.6666 miles 2. Highway driving at 60 mph for 1/3 of the time: Time = 0.5 hours / 3 = 0.1667 hours Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 0.1667 hours = 10 miles 3. Winding roads at 45 mph for 1/3 of the time: Time = 0.5 hours / 3 = 0.1667 hours Distance = Speed * Time = 45 mph * 0.1667 hours = 7.5 miles Total distance to the water park: Total Distance = 4.6666 miles + 10 miles + 7.5 miles = 22.1666 miles Now, let's calculate the time it will take Jake to bike to the water park, considering the different speeds and conditions: 1. Flat ground (30% of the journey) at 11 mph reduced by 10% due to headwinds: Flat ground distance = 30% of 22.1666 miles = 0.3 * 22.1666 = 6.65 miles Reduced speed on flat ground = 11 mph * (1 - 0.10) = 11 mph * 0.9 = 9.9 mph Time on flat ground = Distance / Speed = 6.65 miles / 9.9 mph = 0.6717 hours 2. Uphill (40% of the journey) at 9 mph: Uphill distance = 40% of 22.1666 miles = 0.4 * 22.1666 = 8.8666 miles Time uphill = Distance / Speed = 8.8666 miles / 9 mph = 0.9852 hours 3. Downhill (30% of the journey) at 13 mph reduced by 15% due to wet surfaces: Downhill distance = 30% of 22.1666 miles = 0.3 * 22.1666 = 6.65 miles Reduced speed downhill = 13 mph * (1 - 0.15) = 13 mph * 0.85 = 11.05 mph Time downhill = Distance / Speed = 6.65 miles / 11.05 mph = 0.6018 hours Total biking time to the water park: Total Time = Time on flat ground + Time uphill + Time downhill Total Time = 0.6717 hours + 0.9852 hours + 0.6018 hours Total Time = 2.2587 hours So, it will take Jake approximately boxed{2.2587}  hours to reach the water park by bike."},{"instruction":"A club with 30 members ordered fruit juices.

How many rearrangements of the numbers from 1 to ( n ) have exactly two increasing pairs of consecutive elements?","output":"Given n, we want to find the number of rearrangements of numbers from 1 to n that have exactly two increasing pairs of consecutive elements. Let's denote this value by P(n). 1. **Initial Counting**:    First, we note that each such rearrangement of the numbers 1 to n can be viewed as consisting of three disjoint subsets of {1, 2, ldots, n}, each arranged in decreasing order.    - Example: For n = 6 and the rearrangement 415326, the three decreasing subsets are {4, 1}, {5, 3, 2}, and {6}, with the two increasing pairs 15 and 26. 2. **Counting All Possible Partitions**:    There are 3^n ways to assign each of the n elements into one of the three subsets. This is simply because each of the n elements has three choices (either in the first subset, the second subset, or the third subset):    [    3^n    ] 3. **Adjusting for Overcounted Partitions**:    In 3^n, we have overcounted permutations that have fewer than two increasing pairs. Specifically, we need to subtract those with exactly one or zero increasing pairs. 4. **Counting Permutations with Zero or One Increasing Pair**:    - **Exact One Increasing Pair**:          For a rearrangement to have exactly one increasing pair, this must be the only pair within a longer sequence of decreasing elements.            There are 2^n ways to split the sequence into two parts (before and after the one increasing pair), but there are n+1 special cases where we have zero increasing pairs — every element before the single increasing pair arranged in decreasing order:      [      { { }, { n }, { n, n-1 }, { n, n-1, n-2 }, ldots }      ]      Thus, there are 2^n - (n+1) permutations with exactly one increasing pair:      [      2^n - (n+1)      ]    - **Partitions Corresponding to A Permutation with One Increasing Pair**:          For every permutation with exactly one increasing pair, we have (n+1) ways to place two increasing pairs by splitting one subset into two:      [      (n + 1) left( 2^n - (n + 1) right)      ] 5. **Counting Permutations with Zero Increasing Pairs**:    For zero increasing pairs in the permutation sequence n, n-1, ldots, 3, 2, 1, we need to split it into three subsets by placing two barriers. This gives us:    [    binom{n + 2}{2} = frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}    ]     6. **Final Calculation**:    Combining these, we subtract the unwanted permutations (with one or zero increasing pairs) from 3^n:    [    P(n) = 3^n - ( (n+1) cdot (2^n - (n+1)) + binom{n+2}{2} )    ]        Plugging in the binomial coefficient, we have:    [    P(n) = 3^n - ( (n+1) cdot (2^n - (n+1)) + frac{n(n+1)}{2} )    ]        Simplifying further, we get:    [    P(n) = 3^n - (n+1) cdot 2^n + (n+1)^2 - frac{n(n+1)}{2}    ]        This can be further simplified to:    [    P(n) = 3^n - (n+1) cdot 2^n + frac{n(n+1)}{2}    ] Thus, the number of permutations of {1, 2, ldots, n} with exactly two increasing pairs of consecutive elements is: [ boxed{3^n - (n+1) cdot 2^n + frac{n(n+1)}{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"Suppose for all real numbers x except x=0 and x=1, the function f(x) is defined by [ fleft(frac{x}{x1}right) = frac{1}{x}.] If 0leq tleq frac{pi}{2}, what is the value of f(tan^2 t)?","output":"First, to solve for x using the equation provided: [ frac{x}{x-1} = tan^2 t. ] Rearranging and solving for x gives: [ x = frac{tan^2 t}{tan^2 t - 1}. ] Then, substituting back into the function f: [ f(tan^2 t) = frac{1}{x} = frac{tan^2 t - 1}{tan^2 t} = 1 - cot^2 t. ] Since cot^2 t = frac{cos^2 t}{sin^2 t} and 1 - cot^2 t = 1 - frac{cos^2 t}{sin^2 t} = frac{sin^2 t - cos^2 t}{sin^2 t}, which simplifies to: [ frac{sin^2 t - cos^2 t}{sin^2 t} = frac{-cos 2t}{sin^2 t}. ] Therefore, the solution is boxed{frac{-cos 2t}{sin^2 t}}."},{"instruction":"Given that alpha is an angle in the third quadrant and f(alpha)= dfrac{sin (pialpha)cos (2pialpha)tan (alpha+3pi)}{cos (alphapi)sin (alphapi)} (1) Simplify f(alpha);   (2) If cos left(alpha dfrac{3pi }{2}right)=dfrac{1}{5}, find the value of f(alpha);   (3) If alpha ={{1860}^{{}^{circ }}}, find the value of f(alpha).","output":"Solution:   (1) f(alpha)= dfrac{sin alphacos alpha(-tan alpha)}{(-cos alpha)(sin alpha)}=tan alpha;   (2) cos (alpha- dfrac{3pi}{2})=cos ( dfrac{3pi}{2}-alpha)=-sin alpha= dfrac{1}{5}, Thus, sin alpha=- dfrac{1}{5}, Since alpha is an angle in the third quadrant, Thus, cos alpha=- sqrt{1-sin ^{2}alpha}=- dfrac{2 sqrt{6}}{5}.   therefore f(alpha)=tan alpha=dfrac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} =dfrac{-1}{2 sqrt{6}}=boxed{dfrac{-sqrt{6}}{12}};   (3) alpha=-{1860}^{{}^{circ}}=-180^{circ}times10-60^{circ},   therefore f(alpha)=tan alpha=tan (-60^{circ}) =-tan 60^{circ} =- sqrt{3}=boxed{-sqrt{3}}."},{"instruction":"Which of the following fractions has the largest value? text{(A)} frac{101}{203} qquad text{(B)} frac{47}{93} qquad text{(C)} frac{26}{51} qquad text{(D)} frac{5}{11} qquad text{(E)} frac{199}{401} text{(A)} frac{101}{203} qquad text{(B)} frac{47}{93} qquad text{(C)} frac{26}{51} qquad text{(D)} frac{5}{11} qquad text{(E)} frac{199}{401}","output":"1. **Convert each fraction to decimal or approximate value**:    - frac{101}{203} approx 0.4975    - frac{47}{93} approx 0.5054    - frac{26}{51} approx 0.5098    - frac{5}{11} approx 0.4545    - frac{199}{401} approx 0.4963 2. **Analysis**:    - frac{101}{203} and frac{199}{401} are less than frac{1}{2}.    - frac{47}{93}, frac{26}{51}, text{ and } frac{5}{11} are around frac{1}{2} but only two are marginally greater. 3. **Direct Comparison**:    - Compare fractions greater than frac{1}{2}      - frac{26}{51} > frac{47}{93} since 0.5098 > 0.5054      - Other comparisons are straightforward as frac{26}{51} > frac{5}{11}. 4. **Conclusion**:    - frac{26}{51} is greater than all other options, making it the largest fraction among the given choices.

This approach simplifies the geometry into a more manageable linear form. 1. Let's denote the length of overline{AB} as 1000x and the length of overline{AD} as 2009x, based on the given ratios.

The entire length of the line that represents the parallelogram can be considered as overline{APC} (which is equivalent to overline{AMC} or overline{ANC}, due to the properties of parallelograms and the intersection point P).

Multiplying out the left side, we get frac{4}{x}(x + y + 1) + frac{1}{y + 1}(x + y + 1) geqslant 9. 4. Simplifying, we get 4 + 4frac{y + 1}{x} + frac{x + y}{y + 1} geqslant 9. 5. Since x + y = 3, we substitute 3 - x for y to get 4 + 4frac{3 - x + 1}{x} + frac{x + (3 - x)}{3 - x + 1} geqslant 9. 6. Simplifying, we get 4 + frac{16}{x} + frac{3}{4 - x} geqslant 9. 7. Now, we want to find the minimum value of frac{4}{x} + frac{1}{y + 1}, which is equivalent to finding the minimum value of frac{16}{x} + frac{3}{4 - x}. 8. To do this, we set the derivative of frac{16}{x} + frac{3}{4 - x} equal to zero and solve for x: frac{-16}{x^{2}} + frac{3}{(4 - x)^{2}} = 0. 9. Solving, we find that x = 2. 10. Substituting x = 2 into x + y = 3, we find that y = 1. 11. Plugging these values back into frac{4}{x} + frac{1}{y + 1}, we get frac{4}{2} + frac{1}{1 + 1} = boxed{frac{9}{4}}."},{"instruction":"Which triangle with a unit area can cover the largest square area?","output":"1. **Initial Consideration**:     To cover the largest area square using triangles with a unit area, we need to find the right type of triangles that allow the fitting of a square with the largest possible area.  2. **Positioning of the Square**:    Consider a square inscribed in a triangle such that the square touches the boundary of the triangle at its vertices. If at least two vertices of the square are inside the triangle, as shown in Figure 1, then upon expanding the square, one vertex will be on the boundary of the triangle. Repeating this process, the vertices of the square will eventually be on the triangle's boundary, maximizing the square’s area. 3. **Illustrative Example**:    In Figure 2, a square with three of its vertices touching the sides of a triangle, is shown. Label the points such that XY parallel BC, and assume PB leq PY and CR geq RX. Here, let PS (the side of the square) intersect BC at point D and AC at point E. Due to the assumption PB leq PY, the area of triangle PBD is not larger than the area of triangle PSY. Hence, the area of triangle CDE is smaller than that of triangle ABC.  4. **Scaling Argument**:    By scaling the triangle CDE along with the square to ensure its area becomes one unit, the area of the square PQRS will increase correspondingly. This implies the largest inscribed square touches the boundary of the triangle with one of its sides. 5. **Optimal Triangle**:    From the equality x: d = (x + d): BC, derived from the similarity of triangle ASR and triangle ABC, we get BC = frac{d(x+d)}{x}. Consequently, the area of the triangle becomes frac{1}{2} times frac{d}{x} times (x+d)^2.    By applying the arithmetic and geometric means inequality, we estimate:    [    frac{1}{2} times frac{d}{x} times (d+x)^2 geq frac{1}{2} times frac{d}{x} times (2sqrt{dx})^2 = 2d^2    ] 6. **Maximizing Area**:    The term 2d^2 reaches its maximum when it matches the area of the triangle, which happens if x = d. Thus, d^2 = frac{1}{2}, giving BC = x + d = sqrt{2}. Therefore, the largest area square that can fit into the triangle is within a sqrt{2} base and sqrt{2} height non-obtuse triangle of unit area. # Conclusion: The triangle having a sqrt{2} base and sqrt{2} height, forming a unit triangle without any obtuse angles, can cover the largest possible square area. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Elizabeth wants to buy a pencil that costs 6 dollars.

Let these intersections be points ( E ), ( F ), ( G ), ( H ), and ( R ) as depicted in the diagram. 2. **Constant Products Derived from Powers of Points:**    By the power of point ( P ) with respect to circles ( k_1 ) and ( k_3 ):    [    PE cdot PF = PA cdot PB = PQ cdot PR    ]    From this, we infer:    [    PR = frac{PE cdot PF}{PQ}    ]    Since ( PE cdot PF ) and ( PQ ) are constants for fixed circles and line ( PQ ), ( PR ) is also constant.    Consequently, ( R ) is a fixed point. Note that ( PR < PF ) since ( P ) lies inside ( k_1 ), implying ( R ) is an interior point of the segment ( PF ). Thus, ( R ) is an internal point of both ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ). 3. **Behaviour of Points:**    Points ( P ) and ( Q ) remain consistent since ( P ) lies within ( AB ) and most specifically on ( k_1 ).  4. **Dividing the Circumcircle into Arcs:**    The circumcircle ( k_3 ) is divided into three arcs by points ( A, B, ) and ( Q ). Points ( C ) and ( D ) lie on the arcs ( Q A ) and ( Q B ) respectively given ( A ) and ( B ) are inside ( k_2 ) while ( Q ) is outside.    Hence, ( C ) and ( D ) will always be in the same relative positioning on ( k_2 ). 5. **Intersection of Segments:**    We analyze intersections:    [    SG cdot SH = SC cdot SD = SQ cdot SR    ]    Using signed distances, we get:    [    SG = frac{RG cdot GQ}{HG + GQ - RG}    ]    which translates ( SQ ) being constant, thus any point ( S ) formed from intersection points of line segments ( CD ) with ( PQ ) are dependent solely on pre-defined points ( G, H, Q, R ). 6. **Conclusion:**    The intersection ( S ) of all such segments ( CD ) derived through varying lines ( e ) remains invariant. Thus, all such ( CD ) segments intersect at this common fixed point ( S ). begin{equation*} boxed{text{CD segments all intersect at a common point.}} end{equation*}"},{"instruction":"Jessica operates a bakery, and each day she bakes 50 standardsized pie crusts using frac{1}{10} cup of flour per crust.

Hence, any two distinct lines cannot have more than one common point.  2. **Theorem 2:** Two distinct planes either have no common points or intersect in a line, and only in that line.    **Proof:**        - Let's consider two distinct planes, ( P ) and ( Q ).    - If they have a point ( A ) in common, then they must intersect.    - Draw two distinct points ( B ) and ( C ) in the intersection of ( P ) and ( Q ). By definition of plane intersection, ( B ) and ( C ) form a line ( l ) that lies in both planes.    - Any further point common to ( P ) and ( Q ) must lie on this line ( l ), since through any point in the intersection of two planes, a unique line is determined.        Therefore, the intersection of two distinct planes is a line and only in that line. 3. **Theorem 3:** There exists one and only one plane passing through a given line and a point not on the line.    **Proof:**        - Let there be a given line ( l ) and a point ( A ) not on ( l ).    - Every point on ( l ) defines a position uniquely on the plane.    - Suppose two planes, ( P ) and ( Q ), both pass through ( l ) and point ( A ).    - Points on line ( l ) and the point ( A ) uniquely determine a plane because different planes must separate from at least two non-intersecting points or lines, which is not the case here.    - Thus, ( P ) and ( Q ) must be identical since both depend exclusively on the same line and external point ( A ).        Therefore, exactly one plane can pass through a given line and a point not on the line.

Thus, the slope of the tangent line at x=0 is 0, and since it passes through (0,1), the equation of the tangent line is y = 1. # Part 2: Monotonicity of f(x) The derivative of f(x) for any a is f'(x) = e^x - a. - f'(x) is an increasing function since the derivative of e^x is e^x, which is always positive. - When -1 < a leq 0, f'(x) > 0 for all x, making f(x) increasing for all x. - When a > 0, setting f'(x) = 0 gives x = ln a.

This combination implies that ( O ) is a fixed point of ( L_1 ). 3. **Choosing a specific point on a unit circle**: Among all the points on the unit circle centered at ( O ), pick the point ( A ) such that the length of the vector ( L(overrightarrow{OA}) ) is maximized. 4. **Defining another transformation**: Let ( H ) be the homothety (scaling transformation) with center ( O ) that maps the point ( L_1(A) ) back to ( A ). Set ( L_2 = H circ L_1 = H circ T circ L ). 5. **Investigating the properties of ( L_2 )**: Observe that ( L_2 ) is an affine transformation that leaves both points ( O ) and ( A ) fixed.

Calculate the eccentricity e of the ellipse.","output":"Given that a vertex of the ellipse, together with the two foci, forms an equilateral triangle, this vertex must be an endpoint of the minor axis of the ellipse. Let a and b represent the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse, respectively, and let c be the distance from the center of the ellipse to a focus. By definition, the eccentricity e is the ratio c/a. For an equilateral triangle with side length b, we have the following relationships due to a vertex and the foci forming this triangle: 1. The length of each side is equal, so the semi-minor axis b is equal to the distance from a focus to the vertex, which is also b = sqrt{3}c. This follows from the fundamental property of an equilateral triangle where all sides are equal and the altitude (from a vertex to the opposing side) creates a right triangle with a side ratio of sqrt{3} : 1. 2. The semi-major axis a can be found using the relationship a = sqrt{b^2 + c^2}. Substituting b=sqrt{3}c into the above relationship gives us:  a = sqrt{(sqrt{3}c)^2 + c^2} = sqrt{3c^2 + c^2} = sqrt{4c^2} = 2c.

Given (|z| = 3), the set of complex numbers of the form (z^2) lies on a circle with radius (|z|^2 = 9). The distance between (5 + 6i) and (z^2) is maximized when (z^2) lies directly opposite (5 + 6i) on the circle centered at the origin with radius 9.

The total runs scored after 17 matches is now 16A + 87. The new average (A + 3) is calculated by dividing the total runs by the number of matches (17), so we have: New Average (A + 3) = (Total Runs after 17 matches) / 17 A + 3 = (16A + 87) / 17 Now, we multiply both sides by 17 to get rid of the fraction: 17(A + 3) = 16A + 87 17A + 51 = 16A + 87 Next, we subtract 16A from both sides to isolate A on one side: 17A - 16A + 51 = 87 A + 51 = 87 Now, we subtract 51 from both sides to solve for A: A = 87 - 51 A = 36 So, the average score of the batsman before the 17th match was 36.

So, the total distance to be covered for them to be clear of each other is: Total distance = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2 Total distance = 235 meters + 275 meters Total distance = 510 meters Now, we need to convert the speeds of the trains from km/h to m/s to be consistent with the lengths we have in meters. To convert km/h to m/s, we multiply by (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) and divide by (3600 seconds / 1 hour): Speed of Train 1 in m/s = 120 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 h) = 120 * 1000 / 3600 = 33.33 m/s (approximately) Speed of Train 2 in m/s = 95 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 h) = 95 * 1000 / 3600 = 26.39 m/s (approximately) Since the trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds: Relative speed = Speed of Train 1 + Speed of Train 2 Relative speed = 33.33 m/s + 26.39 m/s Relative speed = 59.72 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to be completely clear of each other: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 510 meters / 59.72 m/s Time ≈ 8.54 seconds So, it will take approximately boxed{8.54}  seconds for the two trains to be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"instruction":"Let T = 1  2 + 3  4 + cdots + 2021  2022.

To express ( frac{1}{PB} + frac{1}{PC} ), we use the fact that areas of triangles can help relate the lengths:    [    frac{1}{PB} + frac{1}{PC} = frac{h}{2}left(frac{1}{S_{triangle ABP}} + frac{1}{S_{triangle ACP}}right).    ] 3. **Using Triangle Area Formula**:    The area of a triangle ( triangle ABP ) with height ( AD = h ) can be expressed as:    [    S_{triangle ABP} = frac{1}{2} cdot AB cdot h cdot sin angle PAB.    ]    Similarly, for ( triangle ACP ),    [    S_{triangle ACP} = frac{1}{2} cdot AC cdot h cdot sin angle PAC.    ]    Thus,    [    frac{1}{S_{triangle ABP}} = frac{2}{AB cdot h cdot sin angle PAB},    ]    [    frac{1}{S_{triangle ACP}} = frac{2}{AC cdot h cdot sin angle PAC}.    ] 4. **Combining the Expressions**:    Substitute these expressions back:    [    frac{1}{PB} + frac{1}{PC} = frac{h}{2} left( frac{2}{AB cdot h cdot sin angle PAB} + frac{2}{AC cdot h cdot sin angle PAC} right).    ] 5. **Simplifying the Result**:    Simplify and combine fractions:    [    frac{1}{PB} + frac{1}{PC} = frac{h}{2} cdot frac{2}{h} left( frac{1}{AB cdot sin angle PAB} + frac{1}{AC cdot sin angle PAC} right) = h cdot frac{sin angle BAC}{AP^{2} cdot sin angle PAB cdot sin angle PAC}.    ] 6. **Maximizing the Function**:    Given that point ( P ) is a fixed point within ( angle A ), the quantities ( AB ), ( angle PAB ), and ( angle PAC ) are constants.

Hence, for one group, the number of matches is binom{4}{2} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6 matches. Since there are two groups, we have 6 times 2 = 12 matches in the round-robin stage. 2.

By Vieta's formulas, we have: begin{align*} -a &= z_1 + z_2 = (1 + omega) z_1,  b &= z_1 z_2 = omega z_1^2. end{align*} To find frac{a^2}{b}, we substitute the expressions for a and b: begin{align*} frac{a^2}{b} &= frac{((1 + omega) z_1)^2}{omega z_1^2}  &= frac{(1 + omega)^2 z_1^2}{omega z_1^2}  &= frac{omega^2 + 2 omega + 1}{omega}  &= omega + 2 + frac{1}{omega}. end{align*} Since omega = e^{pi i/3}, we can express omega and frac{1}{omega} in terms of their real and imaginary components: begin{align*} omega &= e^{pi i/3} = frac{1}{2} + i frac{sqrt{3}}{2},  frac{1}{omega} &= e^{-pi i/3} = frac{1}{2} - i frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. end{align*} Substituting these expressions back into our equation for frac{a^2}{b}, we get: begin{align*} frac{a^2}{b} &= left(frac{1}{2} + i frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) + 2 + left(frac{1}{2} - i frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)  &= frac{1}{2} + i frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 2 + frac{1}{2} - i frac{sqrt{3}}{2}  &= 3. end{align*} Therefore, the value of frac{a^2}{b} is boxed{3}."},{"instruction":"Two circles odot O_{1} and odot O_{2} intersect at points P and Q.

A line through P intersects  odot O_2 again at C. Line AP and BC intersect at R. We need to prove that the circumcircle of  triangle PQR is tangent to both lines BP and BR. Here is a detailed step-by-step proof: 1. **Extend CP to meet AB at D, and connect AQ, PQ, RQ.**   2. We start by showing that quadrilateral ABRQ is cyclic.      [ angle QAR = angle QAP ]    This holds because R, Q lie on a straight line through A. 3. By the property of cyclic quadrilateral, the angles subtended by the same segment are equal:    [ angle QAP = angle QPC ]    Since PQ is common chord:    [ angle QPC = angle QBC ] 4. From steps 2 and 3, we have:    [ angle QAR = angle QBC ]    Therefore, A, B, R, Q are concyclic. 5. Since quadrilateral ABRQ is cyclic, we have:    [ angle BAR = angle BQR ] 6. Next, we show another cyclic property dealing with angles subtended by equal arcs:    [ angle ABP = angle BQP ] 7. Therefore, considering angles in cyclic properties:    [ angle BPR = angle BAR + angle ABP = angle BQR + angle BQP = angle PQR ] 8. This implies:    [ BP text{ is tangent to the circumcircle of } triangle PQR. ] 9. Now we show that lines BR and BP are tangent to triangle PQR. We need:    [ angle BRP = angle PQR ] 10. By angle chasing in cyclic quadrilateral BPCQ:    [ angle BCP = angle PBA ]    Thus:    [ angle CRP = angle PAR ]    Also:    [ angle PAR = angle RQP ] 11. Combining the angles, we have:    [ angle BRP = angle BCP + angle CPR ]    Simplifying:    [ angle BRP = angle PBA + angle PAD = angle PRB ] Therefore: [ BR text{ is tangent to the circumcircle of } triangle PQR ] Thus combining all the results, we conclude that the circumcircle of  triangle PQR is tangent to both lines BP and BR.

Let the equation of the directrix be y = d. 2. **Equation for a point on the parabola**: Consider a point (x, 8x^2) on the parabola y = 8x^2.  3. **Distance formulas**: The distance squared from this point to the focus is PF^2 = x^2 + (8x^2 - f)^2, and the distance squared to the directrix is PQ^2 = (8x^2 - d)^2. 4. **Equating distances**: Since points on the parabola are equidistant from the focus and directrix, we have [x^2 + (8x^2 - f)^2 = (8x^2 - d)^2.] 5. **Expanding and matching coefficients**: Expanding both sides gives [x^2 + 64x^4 - 16fx^2 + f^2 = 64x^4 - 16dx^2 + d^2.] Matching coefficients, we find begin{align*} 1 - 16f &= -16d,  f^2 &= d^2. end{align*} 6. **Solving for d and f**: From 1 - 16f = -16d, we deduce f - d = frac{1}{16}.

Part (b): Inscribing a Similar Parallelogram 1. **Definition and Initial Conditions**:    - Given parallelogram ABCD and another parallelogram KLMN.    - We inscribe a parallelogram K'L'M'N' similar to KLMN. 2. **Centroid Calculation and Verification**:    - Note that the centers of the two parallelograms coincide at point O:      - Midpoints of diagonals K'M' and L'N' should lie on the same line as the midpoints of AC and BD for ABCD.      - This ensures both centroids match.     3. **Triangle Similarity**:    - Consider triangles triangle K^{prime}O^{prime}L^{prime} and triangle Koverline{O}L, where O^{prime} and overline{O} are the centers and/or midpoints of respective parallelograms.    - These triangles are similar due to the properties of parallelograms.     4. **Applying Central Similarity**:    - Use center O and similar angle functions alpha and scale factor k as in the triangle case to transform sides.    - Map side AB of ABCD to a desired line l' via this transformation.    - Align side BC through required rotational and similarity scaling.     5. **Intersection and Verification**:    - The intersection of line l' with BC determines a vertex L'.    - Extend this method for intersection and determination of other vertices, ensuring all parallel sides and proportions are maintained to meet similarity criteria. # Conclusion: By following precise geometric transformation and similarity rules, we inscribe the shapes correctly as per given properties. The boxed solution is specific to the conditions: - For part (a), ensuring that the triangle triangle PXY is similar using angle alpha and coefficient k. - For part (b), ensuring vertices K'L'M'N' meet the criteria for inscribed, similar parallelograms. Thus, the final solution process outline ensures clarity on the steps and potential outcomes: boxed{text{{Inscribed triangle and parallelogram defined based on transformations}}}"},{"instruction":"Delta, Beta and Gamma decided to share 40 donuts.

We are to stretch a rope around this setup, which will create a polygon with its vertices at certain points of the perimeter. 2. **Understand the Shape Created by the Rope:**    The rope, when stretched around these polygons, does not necessarily intersect every vertex of every 100-gon. Instead, it forms a convex hull that only touches certain vertices where it needs to enclose the system. 3. **Determine the Nature of the Vertices:**    The vertices of the polygon formed by the rope (convex hull) are essentially the outermost vertices among all the 100-gons.  4. **Count the Possible Vertices on Convex Hull:**    Consider the properties of convex hull:        - A convex hull of a set of points can only be formed by the outermost points.    - Each of the regular 100-gons has 100 vertices, providing a large number of possible vertices to consider.        However, the key here is that the convex hull of points involving regularly spaced vertices in multiple polygons will simplify to a convex shape with fewer vertices scalable by the overall arrangement, rather than the individual polygons.  5. **Using Euler's Theorem (Graph Theory):**    - Euler's theorem for planar graphs states ( V - E + F = 2 ), where ( V ) is the number of vertices, ( E ) is the number of edges, and ( F ) is the number of faces.    - For our setup, we simplify to just count vertex-wise minimal setup. 6. **Argument on Maximum Number of Vertices:**    Even if we assume that all 1000 100-gons are pointy vertices for convex enclosure, realistically the arrangement of such polygons confines to not all defining the boundary. Each vertex doesn't necessitate part of the convex hull's bounds without redundancy for its specific angular offering. This leads to less than the extreme count of individual polygons. **Conclusion:** Thus, the convex hull (polygon formed by the rope) has no more than 99 vertices due to geometrical and combinatory setup arrangement defining outermost enclosure: [ boxed{99} ]"},{"instruction":"There are some baskets of peaches.

Let's first consider the first pair of numbers. Let a and b be positive integers. Ondra was supposed to calculate (-a) cdot (-b), but he calculated -a - b. We know that:     [     -a - b = -a cdot b     ]     which is equivalent to the equation:     [     a + b = a cdot b     ]     Since a and b are positive integers, we need to find pairs (a, b) such that the equation holds. This results in:     [     a + b = ab     ] 2. To solve for a and b, let's rewrite ab - a - b = 0:     [     ab - a - b + 1 = 1     ]     which can be factored as:     [     (a-1)(b-1) = 1     ]     The only pair of positive integers that satisfy this equation is a-1 = 1 and b-1 = 1, leading to:     [     a = 2, quad b = 2     ]     Therefore, the only solution is a = 2 and b = 2. 3. Now, let's analyze the second pair of numbers. The given condition is:     [     ab = (-182) cdot frac{1}{-a - b}     ]     which simplifies to:     [     ab = 182 cdot frac{1}{a+b}     ]     or equivalently:     [     ab(a + b) = 182     ]     To solve this, we consider the prime factorization of 182, which is:     [     182 = 2 times 7 times 13     ] 4. Since a and b are integers and considering the symmetry of a and b (i.e., we can assume a leq b for simplification), let's systematically evaluate all possible factor pairs of 182:     - When a = 1 and b = 182: a + b = 183, does not satisfy ab(a+b) = 182.     - When a = 2 and b = 91: a + b = 93, does not satisfy ab(a+b) = 182.     - When a = 7 and b = 26: a + b = 33, does not satisfy ab(a+b) = 182.     - When a = 13 and b = 14: a + b = 27, does not satisfy ab(a+b) = 182.     - When a = 1 and b = 13: a + b = 14 does satisfy ab(a + b) = 182:         [         ab(a + b) = 1 cdot 13 cdot 14 = 182         ]     Hence, a = 1 and b = 13 is a solution. 5.

Given that ( f ) is a differentiable function such that ( f(f(x)) = x ) for ( x in [0,1] ) and ( f(0) = 1 ). We need to find the value of the integral:    [    int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx    ] 2. Since ( f(f(x)) = x ), ( f ) is an involution, meaning ( f ) is its own inverse. This implies that ( f ) is a bijection on ([0,1]). 3. Let us consider the substitution ( t = f(x) ). Then, ( x = f(t) ) and differentiating both sides with respect to ( t ), we get:    [    dx = f'(t) , dt    ] 4. Using the substitution ( t = f(x) ), the integral becomes:    [    I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx = int_0^1 (f(t) - t)^{2016} f'(t) , dt    ] 5.

Since ( f ) is a bijection, we can change the variable in ( J ) by setting ( u = f(x) ). Then ( du = f'(x) , dx ) and the limits of integration remain the same because ( f ) maps ([0,1]) onto itself. Thus:    [    J = int_0^1 (f(f(x)) - f(x))^{2016} f'(x) , dx = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} f'(x) , dx    ] 8. Since ( f ) is differentiable and ( f(f(x)) = x ), we have:    [    f'(f(x)) f'(x) = 1    ]    This implies that ( f'(x) ) is positive and ( f'(x) = frac{1}{f'(f(x))} ). 9.

Therefore, we conclude that:     [     2I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx     ] 13. Solving for ( I ), we get:     [     I = frac{1}{2} int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx     ] 14.

Then, for each pair of consecutive divisors, he computed their greatest common divisor (GCD); the sum of the obtained ( s-1 ) numbers was equal to ( N-2 ). Determine the possible values of ( N ). 1. Notice that ( d_{s+1-i} = frac{N}{d_i} ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, s ). 2. Calculate ( d_{i+1} - d_i ). This difference is divisible by ( gcd(d_i, d_i+1) ), so ( gcd(d_i, d_{i+1}) leq d_{i+1} - d_i ).  3. Let ( r_i = (d_{i+1} - d_i) - gcd(d_i, d_{i+1}) geq 0 ). 4. According to the problem, we have:    [    (d_2 - d_1) + (d_3 - d_2) + ldots + (d_s - d_{s-1}) = d_s - d_1 = N - 1    ] 5. Also, from the given condition:    [    gcd(d_1, d_2) + gcd(d_2, d_3) + ldots + gcd(d_{s-1}, d_s) = N - 2    ] 6. Let's subtract the second equation from the first:    [    (d_2 - d_1 - gcd(d_1, d_2)) + (d_3 - d_2 - gcd(d_2, d_3)) + ldots + (d_s - d_{s-1} - gcd(d_{s-1}, d_s)) = 1    ]    This implies:    [    r_1 + r_2 + ldots + r_{s-1} = 1    ]    Therefore, only one ( r_k ) is 1 and the rest are 0. 7. So, for some ( k ):     [     1 = (d_{k+1} - d_k) - gcd(d_k, d_{k+1})     ]     Since both sides must be divisible by ( gcd(d_k, d_{k+1}) ), we have:     [     gcd(d_k, d_{k+1}) = 1     ]     and:     [     d_{k+1} - d_k = 2     ] 8. Both ( d_k ) and ( d_{k+1} ) must be odd since they differ by 2 and ( gcd(d_k, d_{k+1}) = 1 ). 9. Since ( d_k ) and ( d_{k+1} ) are two consecutive divisors of ( N ), their reciprocals must also form consecutive divisors of ( N ). Let:     [     frac{N}{d_{k+1}} = d_m quad text{and} quad frac{N}{d_k} = d_{m+1}     ] 10. We need to verify the condition:     [     gcd(d_m, d_{m+1}) = frac{N}{operatorname{lcm}(d_k, d_{k+1})} = frac{N cdot gcd(d_k, d_{k+1})}{d_k d_{k+1}} < d_{m+1} - d_m     ] 11. Thus, ( r_m > 0 ) is possible if and only if ( k = m ) and ( s = 2k ). 12. This implies ( d_{k+1} = frac{N}{d_k} ), and since ( N = d_k d_{k+1} ), we conclude ( N ) is odd. 13. Given ( d_{s-1} leq frac{N}{3} ), we get:     [     gcd(d_{s-1}, d_s) leq d_{s-1} leq frac{N}{3}     ]     and:     [     1 geq r_{s-1} geq frac{2N}{3} - frac{N}{3} = frac{N}{3}     ] 14. Therefore:     [     N leq 3     ] 15. Considering ( N > 1 ), we find the only suitable value:     [     N = 3     ] 16. We verify ( N = 3 ):     - Divisors are ( 1 ) and ( 3 ).     - The sum of GCD differences is ( 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 ), which matches ( 3 - 2 = 1 ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{N = 3} ]"},{"instruction":"Determine the number of integers N between 1 and 1985 such that the improper fraction frac{N^2+3}{N+2} is not in lowest terms.

After two years, he aims to sell the refrigerator, targeting a profit of 15% on the original labelled price. At what price should Ramesh sell the refrigerator after two years to achieve his profit goal?","output":"First, let's calculate the original labelled price (Rs. X) of the refrigerator. Let's denote the labelled price as X. After a 20% discount, the price becomes: X - 0.20X = 0.80X Then, a further 10% discount is applied, so the price becomes: 0.80X - 0.10(0.80X) = 0.80X - 0.08X = 0.72X We know that after both discounts, the final price is Rs. 12,500: 0.72X = 12,500 X = 12,500 / 0.72 X = 17,361.11 (approximately) Now, let's calculate the total amount paid by Ramesh, including taxes and additional costs. The 5% VAT is levied on the post-discount purchase price of Rs. 12,500: VAT = 0.05 * 12,500 = 625 The total cost before the luxury tax, including transport and installation, is: Total cost before luxury tax = 12,500 + 125 + 250 + 625 = 13,500 The 10% luxury tax is then applied on this total cost: Luxury tax = 0.10 * 13,500 = 1,350 The total amount paid by Ramesh is: Total amount paid = 13,500 + 1,350 = 14,850 Now, Ramesh wants to invest this amount at a 5% compound interest rate for two years. The formula for compound interest is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money). r = the annual interest rate (decimal). n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year. t = the time the money is invested for, in years. Since the interest is compounded annually (n = 1) and the rate is 5% (r = 0.05), the formula for two years (t = 2) becomes: A = 14,850(1 + 0.05/1)^(1*2) A = 14,850(1 + 0.05)^2 A = 14,850(1.05)^2 A = 14,850 * 1.1025 A = 16,372.38 (approximately) Finally, Ramesh wants to sell the refrigerator at a 15% profit on the original labelled price. The selling price (SP) should be: SP = X + 0.15X SP = 1.15X SP = 1.15 * 17,361.11 SP = 19,965.28 (approximately) Therefore, Ramesh should sell the refrigerator for approximately Rs. boxed{19,965.28}  after two years to achieve his profit goal."},{"instruction":"John has 25 horses.

The transition between positions for each switch is sequential from A to B, B to C, C to D, D to E, and from E back to A. Initially, each switch is in position A. These switches are uniquely labeled with integers of the form (2^{x})(3^{y})(7^{z}), where x, y, and z can have values from 0 to 6. In a sequence of 500 steps, for step i (1 through 500), the ith switch is moved forward by one position, and so are all other switches whose labels divide the label of the ith switch. How many switches will be in position A after step 500?","output":"Each ith switch, represented by (x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i}), is advanced once during step i; additionally, it will be advanced by any switch labeled by (x_{j}, y_{j}, z_{j}) if 2^{x_i}3^{y_i}7^{z_i} divides 2^{x_j}3^{y_j}7^{z_j}. Define N = 2^6 cdot 3^6 cdot 7^6 as the largest label. The total count of advancements for a switch with label d_i = 2^{x_i}3^{y_i}7^{z_i} comes from the divisor count of frac{N}{d_i} = 2^{6-x_i}3^{6-y_i}7^{6-z_i}. For the switch to be back in position A, it must have been advanced a total of 5m times, where m is a whole number, so we require: [ 5m = (7-x+1)(7-y+1)(7-z+1) ] for each of (x, y, z) in the range 0 leq x, y, z leq 6. Calculating the count for each configuration: - Cases with each factor multiple of 5: Directly calculate 4 times 4 times 4 = 64 valid configurations. - Adjust for overcounts and cases where the divisor count isn't a multiple of 5.

We know that the mall is 25 kilometers away from Yahya's house and that there are 5 stops in between. Since the bus stops every 5 minutes, for 5 stops, the total stopping time will be 5 stops * 5 minutes/stop = 25 minutes. However, we need to consider that the time between the first stop (Yahya's house) and the second stop is not included in these 25 minutes, as well as the time from the last stop to the mall. Since there are 5 stops, there are actually 6 intervals of travel (from Yahya's house to the first stop, then between each of the 4 subsequent stops, and finally from the last stop to the mall). Therefore, the total travel time will be 25 minutes (for the stops) plus 5 minutes for each of the 6 intervals, which is an additional 30 minutes. So, the total travel time is 25 minutes + 30 minutes = 55 minutes. To find the average speed, we use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours since speed is typically measured in kilometers per hour (km/h). There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 55 minutes is 55/60 hours. Speed = 25 km / (55/60 hours) Speed = 25 km / (11/12 hours) Speed = 25 km * (12/11 hours) Speed = 300/11 km/h Speed ≈ 27.27 km/h Therefore, the average speed of the Pinedale bus line is approximately boxed{27.27}  km/h."},{"instruction":"The students in Mr. Smith's literature class are assigned to read a 900page book.

Since overrightarrow{AD} = overrightarrow{CB}, We have (x-1, y-2) = (-2, 1), Which leads to x-1=-2 and y-2=1. Solving these equations, we get x=-1 and y=3. Hence, the complex number corresponding to the fourth vertex is boxed{-1+3i}. This problem involves the correspondence between complex numbers and points in the complex plane. By simplifying the given complex number and determining the positions of the corresponding points, we can find the fourth vertex of the square using the properties of parallel vectors in a square.

This gives us 9 - 3 = 6. - If both points have negative signs, we again calculate the distance as the difference in their absolute values, which is |-3| - |-9| = 3 - 9 = -6. However, distance is always positive, so we take the absolute value, giving us 6. 2. **Opposite Sign Scenario:** - If point A is positive and point B is negative, or vice versa, the distance between them is the sum of their absolute values. This is because they are on opposite sides of the origin. Therefore, we have 9 + 3 = 12 or 3 + 9 = 12.

We need to prove that ( 30 ) divides ( p_1 - q_1 ). 2. Consider a general set of prime numbers ( x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < x_4 ) such that ( x_4 - x_1 = 8 ) and ( x_1 > 5 ). Any prime ( p > 3 ) must satisfy ( p equiv pm 1 pmod{6} ). 3. Since ( x_4 - x_1 = 8 equiv 2 pmod{6} ), the only possible case is ( x_4 equiv 1 pmod{6} ) and ( x_1 equiv -1 pmod{6} ).

Thus, ( p_1 - q_1 equiv 0 pmod{6} ), which means ( 6 mid (p_1 - q_1) ). 5. Now consider the set ( S = {x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4} ).

If ( x_1 equiv 1 pmod{3} ), then both ( x_1 + 2 ) and ( x_1 + 5 ) are not primes, which is not possible. Thus, ( x_1 equiv 2 pmod{3} ). In this case, only ( x_1 + 4 ) is not a prime, which is indeed possible. Therefore, we have ( x_1 = x_1 ), ( x_2 = x_1 + 2 ), ( x_3 = x_1 + 6 ), ( x_4 = x_1 + 8 ). 7.

This is a contradiction since ( x_4 ) is a prime.    - Case 2: If ( x_1 equiv 3 pmod{5} ), then ( 5 mid x_2 ). This is a contradiction since ( x_2 ) is a prime.    - Case 3: If ( x_1 equiv 4 pmod{5} ), then ( 5 mid x_5 ). This is a contradiction since ( x_5 ) is a prime. 8.

This means that the retail price of the video recorder is 200 plus x% of 200. The retail price (R) can be calculated as follows: R = 200 + (200 * x/100) When the employee applies the 10% discount, they pay 90% of the retail price. So, the price the employee paid (P) is: P = 0.9 * R We know that the employee paid 216 for the recorder, so we can set up the equation: 216 = 0.9 * R Now we can substitute the expression for R from the first equation into the second equation: 216 = 0.9 * (200 + (200 * x/100)) Now we can solve for x: 216 = 180 + (180 * x/100) Subtract 180 from both sides to isolate the term with x: 36 = (180 * x/100) Now we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 180 and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage: x/100 = 36 / 180 x = (36 / 180) * 100 x = 0.2 * 100 x = 20 Therefore, the percentage markup on the wholesale cost was boxed{20%} ."},{"instruction":"f x text{ Y } y is defined as x text{ Y } y = x^2  3xy + y^2, find the value of 4 text{ Y } 3.","output":"Given that x text{ Y } y = x^2 - 3xy + y^2, we need to calculate 4 text{ Y } 3: [ 4 text{ Y } 3 = 4^2 - 3(4)(3) + 3^2 ] [ = 16 - 36 + 9 ] [ = 25 - 36 ] [ = -11 ] So, (boxed{-11}) is the solution."},{"instruction":"A train travels from New York to Chicago at an average rate of 60 miles per hour and arrives in Chicago at 5:00 in the evening, Chicago time.

Given f(x)=sin 2x - cosleft(x+frac{3pi}{4}right), we can use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression. Recall that sin 2x = 2sin xcos x and cosleft(x+frac{3pi}{4}right) = -sin x - cos x (using the cosine of sum formula and the fact that sinleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) = cosleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}). Thus, we can rewrite f(x) as: [ f(x) = 2sin xcos x + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(sin x + cos x) ] Next, let t = sin x + cos x. We can express t in terms of a single trigonometric function using the identity sin x + cos x = sqrt{2}sinleft(x+frac{pi}{4}right). Therefore, t can range from -sqrt{2} to sqrt{2} because the sine function ranges from -1 to 1.  [ t = sqrt{2}sinleft(x+frac{pi}{4}right) in [-sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}] ] Now, we express 2sin xcos x in terms of t. Recall that 2sin xcos x = sin 2x = t^2 - 1 (using the Pythagorean identity sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1 and the definition of t). Thus, we can express f(x) as: [ f(x) = t^2 - 1 + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}t ] Simplifying further, we get: [ f(x) = (t + frac{sqrt{2}}{4})^2 - frac{9}{8} ] From this expression, we see that the function f(x) reaches its minimum value when t = -frac{sqrt{2}}{4}, giving y_{min} = -frac{9}{8}.

Thus, M is at left( frac{a(a - 2)}{a^2 + 1}, frac{2 - a}{a^2 + 1} right). Therefore, |OM| = sqrt{frac{(a - 2)^2}{a^2 + 1}} = sqrt{frac{a^2 - 4a + 4}{a^2 + 1}}. Let y = frac{a^2 - 4a + 4}{a^2 + 1}, then the quadratic equation in terms of a is (1 - y)a^2 - 4a + (4 - y) = 0. The discriminant must be non-negative: Delta = 16 - 4(1 - y)(4 - y) geq 0. Solving the inequality, we get 0 leq y leq 5. Therefore, the maximum value of |OM| is boxed{sqrt{5}}. In conclusion, by considering the cases a = 0 and a neq 0 separately, and setting y = frac{a^2 - 4a + 4}{a^2 + 1}, we use the discriminant to find the range of y, from which we determine the maximum value of |OM|.

If each person writes 6 pairs, there will be 7 pairs more than planned. This can be represented as 6x = text{Planned} + 7. 2. If each person writes 5 pairs, there will be 13 pairs fewer than planned. This can be represented as 5x = text{Planned} - 13. From these two equations, we aim to eliminate the variable \\"Planned\\" to find a relationship between 6x and 5x. To do this, we can set up an equation that directly compares the outcomes of writing 6 pairs per person to writing 5 pairs per person, taking into account the differences from the planned number of pairs. Given that writing 6 pairs results in 7 more than planned, and writing 5 pairs results in 13 fewer than planned, we can set up the equation as follows: [6x - 7 = 5x + 13] This equation directly compares the two scenarios by accounting for the differences in the number of pairs written (more or fewer) from the planned amount.

He turns to his right. Since he was facing north, turning to his right means he is now facing east. He walks 15 meters in this direction. Now, let's visualize Rohit's movements on a grid: - He starts at point A (the starting point). - He moves 25 meters south to point B. - He turns left (east) and moves 20 meters to point C. - He turns left (north) and moves 25 meters back to a point D, which is directly east of point A. - He turns right (east) and moves 15 meters to point E. At this point, Rohit is at point E. To find out how far he is from the starting point (point A), we need to calculate the distance between points A and E. Since points A and D are aligned vertically, and Rohit moved 20 meters from B to C (which is the same distance from A to D), we know that the horizontal distance between A and E is 20 meters (the distance from A to D) plus 15 meters (the distance from D to E), which equals 35 meters.

Since (i - 2 - k) forms even pairing and transformation by induction shows (k) and (i) are same parity. 5. **Adjustment for Inductive Step**    - We can regroup (2N - 1) entities into pairs.    - Let pairs include (A_1) connected with (A_i) and other combinations. 6. **General Case and Conclusion**    - For any combination, the parity of intersections would hold the same if the count remains even, altered by the inclusion of new points.    - Suppose the (i^{th}) point is altered: each restructuring retains the odd/even pairing balance.

This similarity arises from the shared angle (angle BCD) and the angles at points ( L ) and ( M ) being right angles (since ( S_2 ) is tangent to the circle ( S ) at point ( C )):    [    frac{CL}{CB} = frac{CM}{CD} = frac{r_2}{R}    ]    where ( r_2 ) is the radius of the circle ( S_2 ). 3. **Parallel Lines and Parallelogram**    Given that lines ( KL ) and ( MN ) are parallel, segments ( KN ) and ( ML ) are also parallel and equal in length. This configuration suggests that ( KLMN ) forms a parallelogram. Hence, we can write:    [    KN = ML    ] 4. **Proportional Segments**        Since ( K ) and ( N ) are points of tangency, the segments ( KN ) and ( ML ) are respectively proportional to segments of the quadrilateral ( ABD ) and ( CBD ):    [    KN = frac{r_1}{R} cdot BD    ]    [    ML = frac{r_2}{R} cdot BD    ] 5. **Equality of Radii**    From the equality ( KN = ML ):    [    frac{r_1}{R} cdot BD = frac{r_2}{R} cdot BD    ]        Canceling out the common term (cdot BD) and ( R ), we get:    [    r_1 = r_2    ] # Conclusion: Thus, the radii of circles ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) are equal. Hence, we have: [ boxed{r_1 = r_2} ]"},{"instruction":"On a Saturday night, each of the rooms at a certain motel was rented for either 40 or 60.

The total rent the motel charged for that night is then 40x + 60y. According to the problem, if 10 of the rooms that were rented for 60 had instead been rented for 40, the total rent would have been reduced by 50 percent. This means that the new total rent would be half of the original total rent. If we move 10 rooms from the 60 category to the 40 category, the new total rent would be: New total rent = 40(x + 10) + 60(y - 10) We know that this new total rent is half of the original total rent, so we can set up the equation: 40(x + 10) + 60(y - 10) = 1/2 (40x + 60y) Expanding both sides gives us: 40x + 400 + 60y - 600 = 1/2 (40x) + 1/2 (60y) Simplifying further: 40x + 60y - 200 = 1/2 (40x) + 1/2 (60y) Now, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2(40x + 60y - 200) = 40x + 60y 80x + 120y - 400 = 40x + 60y Now, let's subtract 40x + 60y from both sides: 80x + 120y - 400 - 40x - 60y = 0 40x + 60y - 400 = 0 Now, let's add 400 to both sides: 40x + 60y = 400 This equation tells us that the difference in rent from moving 10 rooms from the 60 category to the 40 category is 400. Since this difference represents a 50% reduction in the total rent, the original total rent must be twice 400, which is 800.

The outflow rate is given by the function ( w = 120 sqrt{6 t} ) where ( t ) is the time in hours ( ( 0 leq t leq 24 ) ).  Part (1): 1. **Establishing Definitions:**    Let's denote ( m ) as the constant hourly inflow rate of water in cubic meters. We need to find ( m ) such that the total water inflow over 24 hours equals the total water outflow, ensuring the water volume remains 400 cubic meters at the next midnight. 2. **Total Inflow Calculation:**    The total inflow over 24 hours would be:    [    text{Total Inflow} = 24m    ] 3. **Total Outflow Calculation:**    The outflow rate ( w ) over 24 hours is given by integrating the function ( w ) from ( t = 0 ) to ( t = 24 ):    [    text{Total Outflow} = int_{0}^{24} 120 sqrt{6 t} , dt    ] 4. **Performing Integration:**    Since:    [    int 120 sqrt{6t} , dt    ]    we make the substitution ( u = 6t ) and ( du = 6 , dt ).

Any triangle formed by these vertices must contain exactly 2 colors. 2. **Contradiction with 6 Edges of the Same Color:**    If one of the vertices, say ( v ), has at least 6 edges of the same color, say red, then we can form a triangle with 3 vertices connected by red edges. This triangle would not satisfy the condition of having exactly 2 colors. Hence, no vertex can have 6 or more edges of the same color. 3. **Case with 5 Edges of the Same Color:**    If a vertex ( v ) has 5 edges of the same color, say yellow, let ( S ) be the set of vertices connected to ( v ) by yellow edges. Then ( G - S ) (the graph excluding ( S )) must have no yellow edges. This is because any edge from ( G - S ) to ( S ) must be yellow, which would again form a triangle with only one color (yellow), contradicting the condition. 4. **Case with ( n geq 13 ):**    If ( n geq 13 ), then ( n ) must be 13, and every vertex must have 4 edges of each color (red, yellow, and green). This is because if any vertex had more than 4 edges of the same color, it would contradict the previous steps. 5. **Double Counting Argument:**    We will double count the number of pairs of edges that are adjacent together at one vertex and have the same color.

Thus, we can reject the possibility where b = 9. Let's reduce (b).      - (98cde): For a = 9 and b = 8, removing cde results in 98, which is not divisible by 11.      Hence, b = 8 is a candidate. 5. **Analyzing further places:**    - With d and e remaining, similar steps follow to ensure the difference after potential deletions are not multiples of 11.    - Let's proceed with this insight for further digits:            - (987cde), we choose c = 7: This combination ensures subtracting overline{76} yields non-divisible by 11 number. We continue.      - For d:        - (d = 6): The checking for removal of intermediate states leaves:        - (9876e): Checking the remaining digits, ensures the remaining numbers such as sequences are not divisible.        - For:              - Finally determining (e):        - e = 5: Here, all digits interacting ensure non-multiples after delimiter removal. Combining all digits step-by-step, the largest suitable number is identified. Therefore, the largest five-digit integer meeting all stipulated conditions is: [ boxed{98765} ]"},{"instruction":"Part of Stella's job is to restock the toilet paper in each of the 6 bathrooms at the bed and breakfast.

What is the height of the carton?","output":"To find the height of the carton, we need to determine how many soap boxes can be stacked within the given base area of the carton (25 inches by 42 inches) and then use the maximum number of soap boxes (150) to find the height. First, let's find out how many soap boxes can be placed on the base of the carton. We'll assume the soap boxes are placed with their 7-inch and 12-inch sides on the base. The number of soap boxes that can be placed along the 25-inch side of the carton: 25 inches / 7 inches = 3.5714 Since we can't have a fraction of a soap box, we'll take the whole number, which is 3 soap boxes. The number of soap boxes that can be placed along the 42-inch side of the carton: 42 inches / 12 inches = 3.5 Again, we'll take the whole number, which is 3 soap boxes. Now, let's calculate the total number of soap boxes that can be placed on the base of the carton: 3 (along the 25-inch side) * 3 (along the 42-inch side) = 9 soap boxes With 9 soap boxes on the base, we need to find out how many layers of soap boxes can be stacked to reach the maximum of 150 soap boxes. Number of layers = Maximum number of soap boxes / Number of soap boxes per layer Number of layers = 150 / 9 Number of layers = 16.6667 Since we can't have a fraction of a layer, we'll take the whole number, which is 16 layers. Now, we know that each soap box has a height of 5 inches, so the height of the carton can be calculated as follows: Height of the carton = Number of layers * Height of one soap box Height of the carton = 16 * 5 inches Height of the carton = 80 inches Therefore, the height of the carton is boxed{80}  inches."},{"instruction":"f the range of the function f(x) on [m, n] (m < n) is exactly [m, n], then f(x) is called an equal value mapping interval of the function.

Using the ratios of corresponding sides:      [      M M_1 = frac{Q C cdot A M}{A Q} = frac{2 x cdot y}{x} = 2 y.      ] 3. **Establishing further similarity**:    - Since B K_1 = K K_1 and M M_1 = M_1 B, triangles Delta M_1 B K_1 and Delta M B K are similar with a similarity ratio of 2 (from frac{KK_1}{BK_1} = frac{z/2}{z} and frac{MM_1}{BM_1} = frac{2y}{4y} = frac{1}{2}). 4. **Using cosine of angle B for area similarity**:    - Remember, area ratios for similar triangles are squares of the side ratios, using known lengths and ratios:      [      frac{Area(Delta M_1 B K_1) }{Area(Delta A B C) } = left(cos angle Bright)^2.      ]      Calculating specific ratios:      [      frac{B M_1 cdot B K_1}{B A cdot B C} = frac{2 y cdot frac{z}{2}}{5 y cdot 2 z} = cos^2 angle B,      ]      [      frac{ 2yz/2 }{ 10yz } = frac{1}{10} = cos^2 angle B,      ]      [      cos(angle B) = frac{1}{sqrt{10}}.      ] 5. **Final calculation**:    - Substitute cos (angle B) = frac{1}{sqrt{10}} back into the similarity ratio for M K: AC:      [      MK: AC = 2 cos (angle B) = 2 cdot frac{1}{sqrt{10}} = frac{2}{sqrt{10}} = frac{2 sqrt{10}}{10} = frac{sqrt{10}}{5}.      ]       Conclusion:  [ boxed{frac{2}{sqrt{10}}} ]"},{"instruction":"Prove that if the opposite sides of the hexagon A B C D E F inscribed in a circle are parallel, then its diagonals A D, B E and C F are equal.","output":"1. **Given:** A hexagon ABCDEF is inscribed in a circle, and its opposite sides are parallel. We need to show that the diagonals AD, BE, and CF are equal. 2. **Step 1:** Note that since the hexagon ABCDEF is inscribed in a circle, each of its sides subtends an arc of the circle.  3. **Step 2:** Since the opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, the angles subtended by each pair of opposite sides are equal. Therefore, the arcs subtended by AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA are equal, respectively. 4. **Step 3:** Let's denote the center of the circle by O. 5. **Step 4:** According to the inscribed angle theorem, angles subtended by equal arcs are equal. Thus, the central angles angle AOB, angle COD, and angle EOF are equal. 6. **Step 5:** Knowing that the sum of the central angles for the entire circle is 360^circ, and the above-mentioned three central angles divide the circle into six equal parts, each of these central angles must be:    [    angle AOB = angle COD = angle EOF = 60^circ    ] 7. **Step 6:** Considering the cyclic nature of the hexagon ABCDEF and the corresponding inscribed angles, we see that every arc between vertices will be equal since all are spanned by 60^circ. Further, chords corresponding to each arc of 60^circ will be equal. 8. **Step 7:** Let us consider the diagonals AD, BE, and CF. These diagonals span three arcs, each summed up to 180^circ since three 60^circ segments equal half a circle. 9. **Step 8:** Since diagonals AD, BE, and CF subtend arcs of 180^circ and these diagonals are actually chords subtracted by multiple of equal 60^circ arcs, by the **theorem of equal chords**, chords subtending equal arcs must be equal. 10. **Conclusion:**     Thus, the diagonals AD, BE, and CF must be equal. boxed{AD = BE = CF}"},{"instruction":"Factorize: a^{3}bab=______.","output":"To factorize the given expression a^{3}b-ab, we start by factoring out the common factor, which is ab: [ a^{3}b-ab = ab(a^{2}-1) ] Next, we recognize that a^{2}-1 is a difference of squares, which can be factored further into (a+1)(a-1): [ ab(a^{2}-1) = ableft(a+1right)left(a-1right) ] Therefore, the factorized form of the given expression is: [ boxed{ableft(a+1right)left(a-1right)} ]"},{"instruction":"f left( r + frac{1}{r} right)^2 = 5, then find r^3 + frac{1}{r^3}.","output":"First, expand and rearrange the given equation: [ (r + frac{1}{r})^2 = 5 implies r^2 + 2 + frac{1}{r^2} = 5. ] Thus, [ r^2 + frac{1}{r^2} = 5 - 2 = 3. ] Now, compute r^3 + frac{1}{r^3}: [ r^3 + frac{1}{r^3} = left(r + frac{1}{r}right) left(r^2 - 1 + frac{1}{r^2}right). ] We already know from above that r^2 + frac{1}{r^2} = 3, so: [ r^3 + frac{1}{r^3} = left(r + frac{1}{r}right)(r^2 + frac{1}{r^2} - 1) = left(r + frac{1}{r}right)(3 - 1). ] [ = left(r + frac{1}{r}right)(2). ] Since (r + frac{1}{r})^2 = 5, we take the square root to find: [ r + frac{1}{r} = sqrt{5}. ] Thus, [ r^3 + frac{1}{r^3} = 2 sqrt{5} = boxed{2sqrt{5}}. ] Conclusion: The new problem results in a valid solution, leading to r^3 + frac{1}{r^3} = 2sqrt{5}."},{"instruction":"Arrange 3 boys and 4 girls in a row.

Let these solutions be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). Then:    [    P_n(a_i) = n quad text{for} quad i = 1, 2, ldots, n    ]    This implies:    [    a_i Q(a_i) = n quad text{for} quad i = 1, 2, ldots, n    ] 3. **Form of ( Q(x) )**:    Since ( Q(x) ) must be an integer polynomial, we can write:    [    Q(x) = c(x - b_1)(x - b_2) cdots (x - b_{n-1})    ]    where ( c ) is a non-zero integer and ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1} ) are distinct integers. 4. **Product of Roots**:    Substituting ( Q(x) ) into the equation ( a_i Q(a_i) = n ), we get:    [    a_i c (a_i - b_1)(a_i - b_2) cdots (a_i - b_{n-1}) = n    ]    Since ( a_i ) are distinct integers, none of them can be zero.

The smallest product of ( n ) distinct non-zero integers is:    [    1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdots n = n!    ]    However, we need to consider the absolute value of the product of ( n ) distinct integers, which can be much larger.

What is the probability that she will have more heads than tails?","output":"1. **Symmetry Principle**: The problem relies on the principle of symmetry; probability of more heads is equal to that of more tails.  2. **Calculate Probability of Equal Heads and Tails**:    - Total outcomes possible: 2^{12} = 4096.    - Number of ways to get exactly 6 heads (and thus 6 tails): binom{12}{6} = 924.    - So, probability P(6 text{ heads}) = frac{924}{4096}.     3. **Complementary Probability**:    - Probability of not 6 heads (or balanced): 1 - P(6 text{ heads}) = 1 - frac{924}{4096} = frac{3172}{4096}.    - Since evenly splitting this probability between more heads and more tails, use symmetry: P(text{more heads}) = P(text{more tails}) = frac{3172}{2 times 4096} = frac{3172}{8192}. 4. **Final Calculation**:    - Hence, the desired probability is P(text{more heads than tails}) = boxed{frac{3172}{8192}}."},{"instruction":"June found 2 birds nest with 5 eggs each in 1 tree and 1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree.

She found 17 birds eggs in total, so to find out how many eggs were in the nest in her front yard, we subtract the eggs she found in the trees from the total number of eggs. 17 (total eggs) - 13 (eggs from trees) = 4 eggs.

The conversion factor between km/hr and m/s is: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s So, to convert 144 km/hr to m/s: 144 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 40 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the electric pole. Since the electric pole can be considered as a point in comparison to the length of the train, the time it takes for the train to pass the pole is the time it takes for the entire length of the train to pass the point where the pole is located. The length of the train is 100 m, and the speed is 40 m/s. The time (t) can be calculated using the formula: t = distance / speed t = 100 m / 40 m/s = 2.5 s So, it will take the train boxed{2.5}  seconds to cross the electric pole."},{"instruction":"the region shown, all right angles are as they appear, and each of the twelve congruent sides marked has a length of 1 foot.

Let the height of this encompassing rectangle be (y) feet, the width is certainly given as 12 feet, thus the area is (12y). The missing staircases each have 4 small squares of area 1 square foot each, making a total of 8 square feet removed. Hence, we have: [ 12y - 8 = 69 ] Solving for (y), we get: [ 12y = 77 ] [ y = frac{77}{12} ] Calculating the perimeter of the existing irregular shape involves summing all visible boundaries: - Horizontal top visible segments: Each segment has length 1 foot; there are 4 such segments totaling 4 feet. - Vertical: The entire left and the final right segments are visible, each has length ( frac{77}{12} ) feet. - Base (= 12) feet.

根据time算出活动结束时间，与“当前时间”进行比较判断，如果当前时间大于等于活动结束时间，则为值2，当前时间小于活动结束时间，则值为1，无法判断则值为0，默认值为0 关于支付场景scene包括: 1、生活缴费(如：话费、水费、煤气费、电费) 2、影票 3、信用卡还款 4、餐饮美食 5、罚没 6、充电(如汽车充电) 7、机票 8、车票 9、船票 10、酒店住宿 11、租车 12、门票 13、购车 14、购房 15、网络购物 16、商超购物 17、中石油加油 18、中石化加油 19、车辆洗护 20、汽车保养 21、地铁 22、公交 23、共享单车 24、共享汽车 25、淘宝天猫 26、京东 27、唯品会 28、拼多多 29、抖音 30、快手 不符合以上归类的，默认为\\"指定消费\\" 关于优惠活动daily、weekly、monthly、total的详细要求: 情况1，如只提到了活动周期内总限n次，则令daily=0，weekly=0，monthly=0，total=n； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=0，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=0，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=m，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=m，total=0； 优惠次数限制逻辑例子： 某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 11:38:10

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 11:44:10

from 1568, lesser officials were allowed to pass on their positions by inheritance, on payment to the parties casuelles of a fee of one-third the value of the office. In 1604, the inheritance of office was newly regulated and expanded. By the introduction of the paulette, so-called after the king's secretary Paulet, the administration of offices was farmed out. Purchasers of an office received this as a heritable property, and had to pay a definite annual sum (initially set at 1 % per cent of the purchase price) to the farmer, who in turn made an annual payment to the treasury. The paulette reinforced the tendencies already in existence towards a privatisation of the generalised power, and in the long run restricted the room for manoeuvre of patronage practices of the high noblesse d'épée. What was new for the royal power in the early seventeenth century was also the basis of its propaganda. The group upholding this development were the 'officials' who had been insulted in the years of civil war as les politiques. They championed the view that the most important legiti- misation of royal rule arose from the order-maintaining character of its power monopoly. The most pregnant formulation of this new notion of government was supplied by Jean Bodin. Until 1572 Bodin had conceived the reform of royal rule he deemed necessary along traditional lines: as a limitation of royal arbitrariness by the participation of estate representatives. After the massacre of 1572 he shifted the basis of his argument to the need for the sovereignty of the king, his most unlimited power possible vis-à-vis all members of society. This notion found all the more widespread support, the further the exercise of rule by the nobility was distant from any notion of 'good order'. From the end of the sixteenth century, the theory of sovereignty was a fixed element in the foundation of generalised royal rule. Henri IV gave this theory a particular stamp, but only for the duration of his reign, depicting himself as peacemaker and father of the country. b. Contradictory development of the ancien régime 'L'Etat c'est moi!' This saying, attributed to Louis XIV, can be taken as the leitmotiv of an interpretation that prevailed for a whole century in historical study of the French ancien régime. It culminated in the theoretical construct of 'absolutism'. The rapid spread of this model of interpretation, which was coined in the second third of the nineteenth century, marked a change in the dominant self-conception of French society in the years after the Franco-Prus-sian war. The prevailing view up till then, if unsatisfactory to many, had seen the Revolution of 1789 as founding a special status for the French nation (so August Comte expressed it), but military defeat promoted the integration of a powerful and splendid pre-Revolutionary epoch into the national hall of fame. The interpretative model of 'absolutism' stressed that the monarchy had succeeded, thanks to a powerful centralised ruling apparatus, in disciplining the nobility and other possessors of local power so that the country could be governed by the royal court from one end to the other. This was effected by a systematic mercantilist policy, the supervision of earlier administrative arrangements, appropriate population policies and rational policies of public order. In a certain sense, the construct of 'absolutism' survived by being ignored. The social-historical research orientation that developed in France from the 1930s around the journal Annales turned its back on questions of political his-tory without criticising any of its specific concepts. The notion of 'absolutism' also found uncriticised entry into the works of Marxist historians. The high points of this incorporation were the (very different!) works of two foreigners, the Soviet historian B.F. Porshnev72 and the British social theorist Perry Anderson.73 Both took the centralisation and expansion of royal ruling power as a proven fact, and differed from earlier interpretations particularly by their judgement that despite outward appearance, absolutism was a form of power representing the general interest of the nobility. Even variants of Marxist his-toriography in which a critique of the interpretation of the ancien régime as a feudal society was undertaken by explaining the forms of this social formation as the expression of two simultaneously existing modes of production74 did not question the governmental effectiveness of the central power. This accordingly found itself in close agreement with the developmental model of French history popular until recently in which the strengthening of the crown in the first half of the sixteenth century was given a positive value,75 and the birth of the modern French nation-state dated from the late sixteenth century. Following the 'anarchy' of the wars of religions, it became possible to discipline the nobility. Admittedly further resistance to the central power occurred in the form of the Fronde (see below). But from the time that Louis XIV governed personally, i.e. without support of a first minister, the crown finally established itself as an effective instance of government. In the wars of the late seventeenth century, however, a crisis situation arose. Depictions of the eighteenth century vary according to the chosen interpretation of the French Revolution. Either the ancien régime is seen as in decline from the start of the century, or else it remains stable until the mid-century and is only then shaken by rapid economic change and the crown's financial crisis. A further variant stresses the slow transformation of social relations, interpreting the Revolution as an interruption in the evolutionary process that was merely a historic accident. Despite these great differences in interpretation of the ancien régime in the eighteenth century, the core of the absolutism construct long remained unaf-fected: in the reign of Louis XIV and to a lesser extent also those of his suc-cessors, 'the state' ruled society. The view represented by Marxists, that the crown was 'in reality' the instrument of the ruling class, could be integrated into this conception to the extent that the state was understood as representa-tive of an overall interest of the nobility, albeit coming into conflict with the limited particular interest of individual nobles. In the last three decades, the theory of absolutism has been brought into question, initially in particular aspects, but increasingly as a whole. In a cer-tain sense, Eugen L. Ashers's study published in 1960, on the difficulties that Colbert encountered in implementing his naval policy, in particular the man-ning of ships, can be seen as the starting point for a new view of French gov-ernment policy. The whole notion of Colbertism as a systematic mercantilist practice very rapidly crumbled, given the manifold indications of a contrary reality. Eventually the role of the intendants as unbending instruments of cen-tralisation efforts was also contested, thus undermining one of the main pillars of the ‘absolutism' construct. The focus on local research made it increasingly clear that the old aristocracy remained powerful in the provinces, and that the crown could only govern with its assistance. Even the assumption that the material position of the nobility had deteriorated with the inflationary deval-uation of payments due from the peasants, in comparison with that of the urban bourgeoisie, is no longer taken as proven. Scarcely anything remains of the thesis that 'absolutism' marked the beginning of the modern state, since historical studies constantly show the opposite of bureaucratisation and rationalisation. A counter-thesis has gradually crystallised. Society was not ruled by the 'state', rather society had the 'state' completely in its grip. Just as earlier on, the old nobility were the decisive force, not only in the provinces but also at court. At the local level, however, otherwise than was previously assumed, an inte-gration of the noblesse de robe into the existing noble strata had already taken place in the seventeenth century.76 In the eighteenth century, this tendency towards a homogenisation of élites also became clear at a national level.77 One high point of this literature challenging the 'absolutism' concept was Roger Mettam's Power and Faction in Louis XIV's France.78 Whereas many works of recent years confined themselves to establishing the erroneousness of the 'absolutism' construct for an individual province or city, or for a particular area of politics, Mettam summarised the results of these detailed studies in an overall interpretation of the system of rule that put paid once and for all to the misunderstanding of 'absolutism'. Interpretation of this historical epoch cannot base itself on the preambles to laws, but must rather seek to reveal the hidden power structure.79 It should also be acknowledged at last that the crown had no intention of appropriating the competence to regulate local affairs. It was only for Paris that it claimed a specific governmental power. Mettam's work is characteristic of the stage of discussion that is regularly reached in historiography when interpretations long handed down are put in question. The ‘revisionists' are first of all concerned not to leave a single stone of the former interpretative edifice in place. This means right away, however, that even though their intention is critical, they are still oriented towards the previous interpretation and its problematic. Anyone who already ventures to assert a new synthesis at this stage generally succumbs to the temptation to highlight aspects that have formerly been neglected. It generally takes a 'second generation' before evaluations are no longer simply the product of an attack on the previously prevailing opinion. For the ancien régime in France (by which most people understand the period from the end of the sixteenth century to the Revolution), it is now stressed above all how structurally decisive the medieval elements in state and society still were. In a certain sense, so it seems to me, a good part of present-day research on the ancien régime continues to reproduce an analytical weakness of the notions it criticises. Whilst the 'absolutist state' is certainly no longer seen as a modern rational edifice, distinct from later forms of state chiefly by a particularly glamorous representation, the back-projection of a separate existence of 'state' and 'society' is not overcome in the revisionist shifting of the power centre on to 'society'. The personal character of power still remains part of the tradition. The possessors of seigneurial judicial power, however, were not just 'social' forces, they were owners of a part of the power that is nowadays described as 'state' power. Conversely, the majority of 'state' offices in the developed ancien régime were not part of a public (state) power, but were private property. 'State' activity was a social process, the dynamic of which was determined to a large extent by private interests of appropriation and status. ”翻译为中文","output":"自1568年起，低级官员就被允许通过支付给特定机构三分之一的职位价值的费用，将其职位遗传给后代。1604年，职位继承制度得到了重新规范和扩展。通过引入所谓的保利税（以国王秘书鲍勒的名字命名），官职的管理被外包出去。购买官职的人将其作为可继承的财产，并必须向承包人支付一定的年费（最初设定为购买价格的1%），承包人反过来又向国库支付年费。保利税加强了已经存在的向一般权力私有化倾向，从长远来看限制了高级贵族的赞助实践操作空间。对于17世纪初的王权来说，新颖之处也是其宣传的基础。支持这一发展的群体是在内战年间被称为政治派的“官员”。他们主张，王权最重要的合法性来自于其维持秩序的权力垄断性。这种新政府观念的最明确表述由让·波丹提供。直到1572年，波丹认为他认为必要的王权改革是沿着传统的路线：通过参与地方代表对王权的专断进行限制。在1572年大屠杀之后，他将论证基础转移到了需要国王的主权上，即国王对社会所有成员拥有尽可能无限的权力。这种观点获得了越来越广泛的支持，因为贵族统治的执行与“良序”概念的距离越来越远。 从16世纪末开始，主权理论成为一般化王权基础中的固定要素。亨利四世给予这一理论特别的印记，但仅限于他在位期间，将自己描绘成和平缔造者和国家之父。 b. 旧制度的矛盾发展 “国家就是我！”这句话，被认为是路易十四的名言，可以看作是对法国旧制度历史研究中盛行了整整一个世纪的解释模式的主题。这一解释模式在19世纪下半叶形成了“绝对主义”的理论构造，并迅速传播开来，这标志着法国社会在普法战争后几年的主导自我认识发生了变化。直到那时，尽管对许多人来说并不令人满意，但普遍观点认为1789年的革命为法国民族创立了一种特殊地位（正如奥古斯特·孔德所表达的），但军事失败促进了将一个强大而辉煌的前革命时代纳入国家荣誉殿堂。 “绝对主义”的解释模式强调，由于强大的中央集权机构，君主成功地约束了贵族和其他地方权力持有者，使得整个国家都能由皇家法庭统治。这是通过系统的重商主义政策、对早先行政安排的监督、适当的人口政策和理性的公共秩序政策来实现的。 在某种意义上，“绝对主义”之构建通过被忽略而存活下来。从1930年代开始在《安娜尔斯》期刊周围发展起来的法国社会历史研究取向背离了政治历史的问题，而没有批评它的任何具体概念。“绝对主义”的概念也未经批评地进入了马克思主义历史学家的著作中。这种吸收的高潮是两位外国人的（非常不同的）作品，苏联历史学家B.F. Porshnev和英国社会理论家佩里·安德森的作品。两人都将王权中央集权和扩张视为既定事实，并且与早期解释特别不同的是，他们的判断是，尽管表面上看，绝对主义是代表贵族整体利益的一种权力形式。即使是那些通过解释这种社会形态的形式作为两种同时存在的生产方式的表现来对旧制度作为封建社会的解释进行批判的马克思主义历史学的变体，也没有质疑中央权力的政府效能。 这自然与直到最近在法国历史发展模型中普遍认同的观点密切相关，其中16世纪上半叶加强王权被赋予了积极价值，而现代法国民族国家的诞生则被追溯到16世纪末。在宗教战争的“无政府状态”之后，就有可能约束贵族。当然，对中央权力的进一步抵抗以农民起义的形式出现（见下文）。但从路易十四亲政，即不依靠首相的支持治理国家的时期开始，王冠最终确立了自己作为一个有效的政府实体。然而，在17世纪末的战争中，出现了一种危机情况。对18世纪的描述因对法国大革命的不同解释而异。要么是从世纪初开始看旧制度就在衰败，要么认为它一直稳定到中叶，然后才因快速的经济变化和王冠的财政危机而受到动摇。另一种变体强调社会关系的缓慢转变，并将革命解释为仅仅是历史偶然中的中断进程。 尽管对18世纪旧制度的解读有着巨大的差异，但长时间以来“绝对主义”构建的核心仍然未受影响：在路易十四的统治下，以及在较小程度上他的继任者们的统治下，“国家”统治了社会。马克思主义者代表的观点，即王权“实际上”是统治阶级的工具，可以被整合进这一概念中，只要国家被理解为代表贵族的总体利益，尽管与个别贵族的有限的特定利益发生冲突。 在过去的三十年中，“绝对主义”的理论受到了质疑，最初是在特定方面，但越来越多是作为一个整体受到质疑。在某种意义上，尤金·L·阿舍尔于1960年发表的一项研究，关于柯尔伯特在实施他的海军政策时遇到的困难，特别是船只的人员配备，可以看作是对法国政府政策新观点的起点。考虑到相反现实的多种迹象，柯尔伯主义作为一种系统的重商主义实践的整个概念很快就崩溃了。最终，作为中央集权努力坚定不移的工具的财政总管的作用也受到了质疑，从而动摇了“绝对主义”构建的主要支柱之一。对地方研究的关注使得越来越清楚，旧贵族在省份中仍然强大，王冠只能在其协助下治理。甚至贵族的物质状况与城市资产阶级相比因农民应付的通货膨胀贬值而恶化的假设也不再被视为已证实。关于“绝对主义”标志着现代国家开始的论点，几乎没有留下任何东西，因为历史研究不断显示出官僚化和理性化的反面。 逐渐形成了一种反论点。社会不是被“国家”统治，而是社会完全掌控了“国家”。正如早先一样，旧贵族是决定性力量，不仅在省份中，而且在宫廷中。然而，与先前的假设不同的是，在地方层面，否则被认为，在17世纪已经发生了将官袍贵族融入现有贵族阶层中的整合。在18世纪，这种向精英阶层同质化的趋势在国家层面上也变得明显。挑战“绝对主义”概念的文献的一个高潮是罗杰·梅塔姆的《路易十四统治下的法国权力与派系》。而近年来的许多作品仅仅局限于为一个单一的省份或城市，或一个特定的政策领域建立“绝对主义”构建的错误性，梅塔姆总结了这些详细研究的结果，对统治体系进行了整体解读，彻底终结了对“绝对主义”的误解。不能基于法律序言来解释这一历史时期，而应该寻求揭示隐藏的权力结构。最后应该承认，王冠无意占有调节地方事务的能力。只有对巴黎，它声称具有特定的政府权力。梅塔姆的工作是讨论达到的阶段的典型，即当长期流传的解释受到质疑时，历史学家们通常会达到这一阶段。“修正主义者”首先关心的是不留下以前的解释建筑中的任何一块石头。然而，这意味着，尽管他们的意图是批判性的，他们仍然面向之前的解释及其问题。在这一阶段已经敢于断言新的综合体的人通常屈服于强调以前被忽略的方面的诱惑。通常需要“第二代”才会不再仅仅是对以前流行观点的攻击的产物。 对于法国的旧制度（大多数人理解为从16世纪末到革命的时期），现在主要强调的是国家和社会中仍然具有决定性影响的中世纪元素。在某种意义上，据我看来，当今对旧制度的研究继续再现了它所批评的概念的分析弱点。虽然“绝对主义国家”不再被视为一个与后来的国家形式主要通过特别华丽的表现不同的现代理性建筑，但在将权力中心转移到“社会”上的修正主义转变中，并没有克服“国家”与“社会”的分离存在的反向投射。权力的个人性质仍然是传统的一部分。领主司法权的拥有者不仅仅是“社会”力量，他们是当今被描述为“国家”权力的一部分的所有者。相反，发达旧制度中的大多数“国家”职位不是公共（国家）权力的一部分，而是私人财产。“国家”活动是一个社会过程，其动态在很大程度上由私人的占有和地位利益决定。"},{"instruction":"请将“b.1. La monarchie absolue: structural change in generalised power In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century France, there was no internal market comprising all partial markets in the kingdom; there was neither a single law nor a language spoken by all the king's subjects; there was no common culture, no common system of taxation, no roads that facilitated long journeys, and quite certainly no unitary structure of administration. Yet contemporaries referred to the king's rule as absolute. What they meant by this, however, was not the centralised instance of power that would later be assumed in the con-cept of absolutism, but rather the fact that the king had certain competences in his uncontested possession: he could make laws, decide on war and peace, settle legal conflicts in the final instance, appoint officials, have money coined, and regulate religious belief. What was contested was his right to raise taxes without agreement. The prerogative power was the possession of the royal person, and from the seventeenth century the king stood out against the dynasty more clearly than before. Externally it continued to be above all the dynasty that reigned. In the settlement of inheritance and marriage strategies, it was still a ‘family' policy that was pursued. Internally, however, the rule of the king in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries lost this family character. After members of the royal house had taken part in the so-called ‘princes' Fronde' of 1648, directed against Mazarin's policies, and sought in this way to gain greater influence on the crown's policy, the traditional claim of the royal family to participation in government was to a certain degree delegitimised. In the so-called polysynodie, a brief form of government during the regency at the start of the eighteenth century, dynastic supremacy and the claims of magnate privilege were integrated together. That the king enjoyed certain uncontested prerogative powers, and had the task of maintaining internal order, did not mean that he was in a position to define for himself the proper exercise of this rule. The contemporary tag of monarchie absolue applied not to the exercise of prerogative power, but simply to its existence. Compared with the phase that the present work denotes as the beginning of the ancien régime, the expansion of this prerogative was immense. In the seventeenth century the crown had been in practice little more than an instance of appeal for the kingdom's courts, an instance of sanction for the social hierarchy, and an instance of distribution for a considerable part of the extracted ‘surplus' product. This expansion in the power of the crown was the result of a process in the course of which rule that was more or less autonomous, or limited only regionally, was integrated into the royal rule. Certain forms of separate pos-session of rule, though by no means all such forms, were considerably cur-tailed in the course of this development. The seigneurial exercise of judicial power and even the seigneurial exploitation of so-called banalités in this way became components of a generalised system of personal rule, i.e. privileges. It is analytically an unhappy choice, therefore, for historians to take the persistence of practices of appropriation that derived from seigneurie banale as evidence for the persistence of feudalism. In the developed ancien régime, seigneurial [ban] rule became a form of private property, which just like other forms of private property was protected, more or less successfully, by royal courts and royal soldiers. The integration of personal possession of rule into the generalised monar-chical power is the key structural characteristic of the developed ancien régime. Certain structures of conflict were typical of this system of 'government'. These cannot, however, justify the conclusion of the existence of institutionalised structures of power distribution that previous research has generally supposed. For all institutions of royal rule could be integrated into local structures of the exercise of rule - even if in the particular case they had been established with the intention of supervising or even emasculating local power. The intendants, for example, were sometimes agents of royal power politics; far more commonly, however, they functioned as reporters on local conditions for the exercise of royal rule, if not even as mouthpieces for regional (ruling) interests. There is a simple reason why institutional structures should be seen as a relatively poor source of evidence for the internal mode of operation of gen-eralised personal rule: this rule was exercised along lines of patronage and clientelism. From the possessor of seigneurial power up to the king, everyone who sought to maintain or extend their rule needed the support of a circle of persons whom they could rely on. Only to a certain extent did membership of a clientele and the internal structure of clientele groups coincide with mem-bership and hierarchy of the formal 'apparatus' of rule. Two things were com-bined in clientelism: the limited instrumental character of all office power, and the integration of familial organisation of the reproduction structure into the objectified pattern of connections of patronage. Even under the developed ancien régime, the family remained the dominant organisational basis for reproduction strategies. In a certain sense, this social form was sanctioned by fiscal arrangements, and by the linking of particular privileges with family origin; at the same time, however, it was also strategically instrumentalised. Kinship connections became central elements in the network of mutual personal dependence and support that was as indispensable for strategies of advance as it was for the exercise of rule. Many clientele groups were restricted to a particular place or a confined region. But situations continuously arose in which families sought to join clientele groups that were more socially elevated and regionally more far- reaching, or where lords sought to obtain influence on local clientele groups. To this extent, it can be said that the entire kingdom was pervaded by mutually competing and interconnected groupings, the content of which rested on convergences of interest that were either temporary or long-term, and on inherited ties of loyalty. This 'system' was internally quite unstable, yet as a whole it was relatively rigid. For without personal connections, no strategies of advance and enrichment were possible, nor even the defence of social positions already attained. In so far as the exercise of royal rule embraced the entire kingdom, this contributed to the integration of even locally limited clientele groups into a geographically and socially more comprehensive com-petition for influence, office and privilege. This expansion of the network of personal connections was also the way that monarchical rule was generalised. Just like other lords, the king and his ministers had to take constant pains to maintain and expand their clientele. For the real strength of the king was dependent on the scope and composition of this. This state of affairs was true for most monarchs in societies of the ancien-régime type, but nowhere was it so pronounced as in a kingdom where almost all offices were the private property of their incumbents. The royal court was not only the meeting point of multifarious strategies for expanding the influence of particular clientele groups; specific conditions also obtained there for the play of particular forms of competition. One of these conditions was court etiquette, which from the mid-seventeenth century ensured that political strategies were pursued in patterns of behaviour in which the eminence of the royal person and the distinction of the court nobility were indubitably represented and thus reproduced in practice. If today we have to reject Norbert Elias's assumption that the high nobility of France adopted the behaviour pattern of etiquette to defend social privileges because they no longer had any real power, the evidence of continuing noble power does not refute his assertion that the nobility used etiquette against those seeking social advance, and that the king used it to demonstrate his own pre-eminence over the nobility. Elias's demand that the court should be studied as a system of rule, ‘that prescribed, like any other, quite specific ways of ruling to the person wishing to control it',80 remains equally valid. The mastery that Louis XIV attained in this art of ruling has recently been impressively described. Paul Sonnino has shown how the king managed to pursue his war against Holland although most of his advisers initially opposed it.81 Inciden-tally, the scenario that Sonnino depicts makes it quite impossible to interpret this war as an early manifestation of ‘national' economic interests. Whilst analysis of the court system of rule - along with its structural changes in the reigns of particular kings, and even the course of a single reign - is indispensable, if the object is to explain how specific policies came into being, this field of power play has little importance in the overall context of the structural development of personal rule. The following discussion will therefore largely leave it out of consideration. Instead, the manner in which personal rule was generalised will be specified in relation to changes in the possession of rule and the preconditions of its exercise. With a few exceptions, we shall avoid the depiction of specific events and political conflicts. Armed force As far back as 1438, in the so-called ‘pragmatic sanction', it was decreed that no one in the French kingdom had the right to raise an army apart from the king. In 1583, Henri III proclaimed once again this basic principle. On both occasions, what was involved was not declaring a right that could already be implemented, but rather announcing a claim to rule. In 1598, Henri IV found it necessary to accept a limitation on the royal monopoly of armed force. In the agreements appended to the edict of Nantes, he granted the Huguenots a specific number of ‘armed places', and thus the right to raise local taxes and deploy soldiers. It was only in the seventeenth century that the French kings could success-fully claim the monopoly of armed force, and even subsequently, the crown's power over armed force was not complete. Nobles continued to keep armed retainers, if not so many as before, the ban on duels proved impossible to implement, despite exemplary punishments, and the government's disposal of ‘the king's army' was restricted by commissions being the property of their incumbents, and by a company economy. On the other hand, Protestant privi-leges were abolished in the space of twenty years - La Rochelle falling only after a fifteen-month siege.82 After the defeat of the Fronde, the crown succeeded in dissolving urban militias. Though these were established again in 1766, this was now effected not simply at the behest of the crown, but also under the supervision of its officials. Paris remained exempt from this regulation. Instead, special guards companies were established there, initially only mounted divisions, but from 1721 also an infantry one.83 Similarly, under Louis XIV, most of the gendarmerie companies in the provinces were either dissolved, or at least removed from the control of local nobles.84”翻译为中文","output":"b.1 绝对君主制：权力概念的结构性变化 在17和18世纪的法国，并不存在一个涵盖王国所有局部市场的内部市场；既没有统一的法律，也没有所有国王臣民都讲的统一语言；没有共同的文化、共同的税收制度、便于长途旅行的道路，当然也没有统一的行政结构。然而，当代人将国王的统治称为绝对。但是，他们所指的并不是后来在“绝对主义”概念中假设的中央集权实体，而是国王拥有某些无可争议的权能：他可以制定法律、决定战争与和平、在最后实例解决司法冲突、任命官员、铸造货币、以及规范宗教信仰。有争议的是他在未经协议的情况下征税的权利。 这种特权是皇室个人的财产，从17世纪起，国王比以前更明显地突出于王朝之上。在外部，主要还是王朝在统治。在继承权和婚姻策略的解决上，仍然是在实行“家族”政策。然而，在内部，17和18世纪国王的统治失去了这种家族特性。在所谓的“王子叛乱”中，皇室成员在1648年反对马扎林的政策，试图以此增加对王冠政策的影响力，传统上皇室家族参与政府的要求在一定程度上被非法化。在18世纪初摄政期间的短暂政府形式所谓的多辛奥迪中，王朝的至高无上和贵族特权的要求被一起整合。 国王享有某些无可争议的特权，并承担维持内部秩序的任务，并不意味着他能够自行定义这些统治的恰当行使方式。当代标签的“绝对君主制”并不适用于特权力量的行使，而仅仅适用于其存在。与本作品所表示的旧制度开始阶段相比，这种特权的扩展是巨大的。在17世纪，王权实践上不过是王国法院的上诉实体、社会等级的批准实体，以及相当一部分提取的“剩余”产品的分配实体。 王权力量的扩展是一个过程的结果，在这一过程中，或多或少自治或仅在区域上受限的统治被整合到了王权之下。某些形式的独立统治权在这一发展过程中被相当大地削弱，虽然并非所有这些形式都是如此。从而领主司法权力的行使，甚至对所谓的禁令（banalités）的领主剥削，成为了个人统治概念化系统的组成部分，即特权。因此，历史学家将从封建禁地（seigneurie banale）派生的占有实践的持续性作为封建主义持续性的证据，分析上是不幸的选择。在发展完善的旧制度中，领主的[禁地]统治成为一种私有财产形式，这种财产形式就像其他形式的私有财产一样，或多或少成功地受到王室法院和王室士兵的保护。 将统治权的个人占有整合到普遍化的君主权力中，是发展完善的旧制度的关键结构特征。这种“政府”体系的某些冲突结构是典型的。然而，这些不能证明先前研究通常假设的、存在着制度化的权力分配结构。因为所有王权机构都可以被整合到统治行使的地方结构中——即使在特定情况下它们是为了监督甚至阉割地方权力而建立的。例如，监督官有时是王权政治的代理人；但更常见的情况下，他们作为王权行使的地方状况的报告人，如果不是作为地区（统治）利益的发言人的话。 存在一个简单的原因，为什么制度结构被视为分析普遍化个人统治的内部运作模式的相对贫乏的证据来源：这种统治是沿着赞助和宗客体系的线索行使的。从领主权力的持有者到国王，每个寻求维持或扩展其统治的人都需要依靠一群他们可以信赖的人的支持。宗客群体的成员资格和宗客群体的内部结构在一定程度上与正式“统治机构”的成员资格和等级制度重合。宗客体系结合了两个方面：所有办公室权力的有限工具特性，以及家庭组织的生殖结构被整合到客观化的赞助关系模式中。即使在发展完善的旧制度下，家庭仍然是生殖策略的主导组织基础。从某种意义上说，这种社会形式通过财政安排得到制裁，并通过将特定特权与家庭出身联系在一起；同时，它也被战略性地利用。亲属关系成为了个人相互依赖和支持网络的中心元素，这对于推进策略和统治行使同样不可或缺。 许多宗客群体限于特定地点或有限区域。但不断出现的情况是，家族寻求加入社会地位更高、区域范围更广的宗客群体，或者领主寻求对地方宗客群体获得影响。在这个意义上，可以说整个王国被相互竞争和相互联系的团体所贯穿，其内容基于短期或长期的利益一致性和遗传的忠诚联系。“系统”在内部相当不稳定，但作为一个整体则相对僵化。因为没有个人关系，就无法实现推进和致富的策略，甚至无法维护已达到的社会地位。在王权行使覆盖整个王国的范围内，这有助于将局部限制的宗客群体整合到更为广泛的地理和社会竞争中，争夺影响力、职位和特权。个人关系网络的扩展也是君主统治普遍化的方式。就像其他领主一样，国王及其大臣必须不断努力维护和扩展他们的宗客。因为国王的真正力量取决于此。这种情况对于旧体制类型的社会中的大多数君主来说都是真实的，但在几乎所有官职都是其任职者私有财产的王国中，这种情况尤为明显。 皇家宫廷不仅是扩大特定宗客群体影响力的多种策略的汇合点；特定竞争形式的特定条件也在此存在。其中一个条件是宫廷礼仪，它从17世纪中叶开始确保政治策略以表现无疑的皇家身份和宫廷贵族区别的行为模式中进行，从而在实践中得到再现和复制。如果今天我们必须拒绝诺贝尔特·埃利亚斯的假设，即法国高贵族采用礼仪行为模式是为了捍卫社会特权，因为他们不再拥有任何真正的权力，那么持续的贵族权力的证据并不驳斥他的断言，即贵族使用礼仪反对那些寻求社会上升的人，而国王则用它来展示他自己超越贵族的优越性。埃利亚斯要求将宫廷作为一个统治系统进行研究，“就像任何其他系统一样，为希望控制它的人规定了非常具体的统治方式”，这一要求同样有效。路易十四在这种统治艺术中达到的精通最近被生动地描述了。保罗·索尼诺展示了国王如何设法发动对荷兰的战争，尽管他的大多数顾问最初反对它。顺便说一下，索尼诺描述的场景使得不可能将这场战争解释为“国家”经济利益的早期表现。 虽然对宫廷统治系统的分析——连同特定君主统治期间的结构变化，甚至单一统治期间的进程——如果目的是解释特定政策的形成是不可或缺的，但这种权力游戏在个人统治结构发展的整体背景下的重要性较小。因此，以下讨论将基本上不考虑这一点。相反，将指明个人统治普遍化的方式，关注统治权的占有和行使的先决条件的变化。我们将避免描述具体事件和政治冲突，除了少数例外。 武装力量 早在1438年，所谓的“务实制裁”中就规定，法国王国内没有人有权建立军队，除了国王。1583年，亨利三世再次宣布这一基本原则。在这两种情况下，所涉及的不是宣布一个已经可以实施的权利，而是宣布一个统治要求。1598年，亨利四世发现有必要接受对王权武装力量垄断的限制。在纳永敕令附加协议中，他授予胡格诺派特定数量的“武装地点”，从而有权征收地方税并部署士兵。 直到17世纪，法国国王才能成功主张武装力量的垄断，即便在此之后，王冠对武装力量的控制也不完全。贵族继续保持武装随从，尽管数量不如以前多，尽管有典型的惩罚，禁止决斗的禁令被证明无法实施，政府对“国王军队”的支配受到委任状为其持有者所有，以及公司经济的限制。另一方面，新教特权在二十年内被废除——拉罗谢尔在经过十五个月的围攻后才陷落。在粉碎农民起义后，王冠成功解散了城市民兵。虽然这些民兵在1766年被再次组建，但这次不仅仅是应皇冠的要求，而且在其官员的监督下进行。巴黎不受此规定的约束。相反，那里成立了特别的警卫公司，最初只有骑兵部队，但从1721年起也有步兵部队。同样，在路易十四统治下，大部分省份的骑兵团要么被解散，要么至少被剥夺了地方贵族的控制。"},{"instruction":"请将“The implementation of the royal monopoly on armed force assumed not only the real generalisation of royal fiscal power, but also international mili-tary developments - as we shall demonstrate below. Two aspects are especially important in the present context: the developments in artillery and fortifications on the one hand, and of a standing army on the other. An addi-tional factor in many countries was the establishment of ministries of war (the French in 1758), and special administrative posts responsible only for the military. When Henri III rode against the Huguenots in 1572-3, commanding the royal army in person, he had Scipio Vergano accompany him to advise on the siege of La Rochelle. The Italian specialist was well chosen, as he had himself organised the improvement of the fortifications there a few years previously. Employment of Italian, Spanish or Dutch engineers was customary in France at this time. Beside very specific tasks, they were generally commissioned to set up local ‘schools'. At the turn of the seventeenth century, ‘France' had just four engineers of its own. A hundred years later there were three hundred in the crown's service. By this time, moreover, engineers of the ‘French school', which had now become celebrated, were also serving at foreign courts. From the second half of the seventeenth century, already, France had a constant surplus of applicants for engineering positions. Potential candidates frequently served during the king's wars as 'volunteer engineers', in the hope - generally vain - that they might recommend themselves in this way for permanent employment. Those who succeeded in becoming ingénieurs ordinaires of His Majesty established under Vauban's leadership a regular girdle of fortifications along the borders of the kingdom. The development of engineering changed the conduct of war, and changed also the material preconditions for successfully asserting claims to rule. For the high costs of siege warfare favoured strategies aiming at the generalisation of monarchical power. In the same way as this armed competition for ruling power promoted the increased destructiveness of weapons and the correspondingly greater effectiveness of fortification techniques, so it also favoured the invention of military drill. First introduced in the Netherlands, this new social technique spread across Europe with the Thirty Years War. Hans Delbrück - to whom historians owe the explanation of how form of society, social organisation of soldiers, military technique and tactics are connected - characterised the new social technique as follows: These exercises created discipline, and discipline made possible an exactness and precision of the exercises, which were pursued ever further, viewing and treating the individual as an almost arbitrarily replaceable piece of machinery. Even those who had been initially enlisted quite against their will, by flagrant deceit or brute force, often grew accustomed to this exis-tence and to a greater or lesser extent saw it as expressing the spirit and honour of their division.'85 As early as the sixteenth century, so André Corvisier has it, the warriors [ guer-riers] of the Middle Ages were replaced by soldiers.86 But it was only with the introduction of drill as a structural characteristic of military life that, in Delbrück's view, a military institution with permanent conditions of employ- ment developed into a standing army. This new social form was an invention of the seventeenth century. It was also the first social site for the development of abstract 'labour', the transformation of individual workers into the exchange-able 'cogs' of a social machinery. The underlying rationale of military exercise was initially to faciliate the reloading of muskets during battle without pause for thought. It soon became clear, however, that with the help of regular sys-tematic drill, it was possible to make soldiers out of compulsorily enlisted sons of peasants and artisans, convicts who preferred military service to other punishment, and captured 'vagabonds', so that differences of origin, dialect and way of life lost significance in relation to their common vocation. Together with the establishment of particular branches of administration, the practice of exercise was one of the structural preconditions for the gradual separation of 'the military' from 'the civilian'. In France this distinction was still at an early stage when the ancien régime came to an end. The period of engagement certainly grew longer. Already for the time of the Thirty Years War, Robert Caboche has established, on the basis of entries made on acceptance at the Hôtel des Invalides, that a considerable number of soldiers - some 20 per cent of those analysed (most of whom hailed from the northern provinces) - had served for more than thirteen years, and over 40 per cent more than ten years.87 These are clear indications of lifelong service, even if extra years were sometimes added as a bonus. In the seventeenth century, moreover, barracks scarcely existed. Soldiers either bivouacked in the open, or were billeted in private households. Scarcely any privilege under the ancien régime was so urgently requested as exemption from billeting. Not only was this arrangement inconvenient, for many it also involved a tremendous financial burden. In the course of the eighteenth century many cities built barracks precisely in order to spare their citizens the billeting of soldiers in their houses. But during the Wars of the Spanish Succession, when the army contained many compulsorily enlisted recruits, the accommodation of soldiers in private houses was still typical and common not only in the countryside, but also in the towns. Many people were thus familiar with the living conditions of soldiers, and this may explain why many were prepared to help the numerous deserters that there also were at this time.88 From the time that the crown sent intendants out to the provinces, to make administration more effective and controlled, the violent attacks of soldiers on civilians were reduced (though by no means everywhere); robbing expeditions by discharged foreign mercenaries also became more rare. The standing army was supposed to consist in the main of volunteers. Compulsory enlistment was actually forbidden in 1692, at least in formal terms. Contracts were then made for a term of eight years. During the service period and for one year after, soldiers were exempt from the taille, which, on the one hand, put them in a similar position to the nobility, while, on the other, it spared the crown money on their payment. Sometimes, though less commonly than was formerly supposed, prisoners were pardoned if they were prepared to join the army; former galley slaves, however, who had been branded, were not accepted in the army, though vagabonds frequently were. The pay of a simple soldier matched that of a journeyman in a moderately respected trade. Companies composed of foreign soldiers received better pay, but were also under stricter discipline. Efforts were repeatedly made to transform the royal militia into a volunteer force. Because these failed, the militia was actually abolished for a four-year period in the 1690s. When war began again, the militia was reorganised on the basis of lots. Certain groups were exempted from service, and there were regions from which relatively few soldiers were demanded. Many people who were picked by lot paid substitutes instead. Officially, the service of the militia was confined to guard duty in the garrisons, but in wartime whole divisions were 'incorporated' into the regular army. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-13), this 'incorporation' occurred immediately on the summoning of the militia. The three-year service term, moreover, was not adhered to. According to Corvisier, not a single militiaman was discharged during the years 1708-12 after his service term came to an end.89 In 1702, a total of 220,000 men were under arms in the service of the French crown. A year later, the number had risen to about 300,000, more than ever before in any European kingdom.90 This tremendous military force, however, cannot be simply translated into the strength of the government internally. Since the object of wars was not defence against an invader, but rather to assert dynastic claims, many people did not see why they should put their life or those of their sons at risk, tolerate billeting and pay ever higher taxes. Military abuses reinforced this unwillingness. It was precisely in wartime, however, that the crown found it almost impossible to keep regiments ready for the purpose of putting down possible unrest. Their repressive power was confined to punishment expeditions - though these were, as a rule, draconian enough. Wherever possible, foreign mercenaries were employed for campaigns of this kind. Roger Mettam warns against overestimating the crown's capabilities for armed implementation of its policy.91 Even if we take into consideration the tremendous fiscal and directly military burdens imposed by the War of the Spanish Succession, the disturbances and protests that emerged at this time can scarcely be deemed a danger to the system of rule. On the contrary, uprisings were customary phenomena of an exercise of rule that denied whole strata of the population other opportunities of making their interests known. For Louis XVI's reign, a hundred years later, J.F. Bosher reaches a different verdict from that of Roger Mettam on the reign of Louis XIV, seeing the crown's repressive potential as very far-reaching. He refers to the regular army with its strength of 150,000, a large territorial police troop (the maréchausée), 75,000 militia men (though from one decade to the next these were not called up, and not even trained), as well as the royal guards regiments with a further complement of at least 7,000 soldiers.92 The events of summer and autumn 1789, however, made it clear that the military potential of the crown could not be measured in troop strength, let alone its officially reported figures. Not only was the government's power of disposal of the means of repression restricted by the potential and in some cases actual resistance of soldiers to being deployed as a police force against people whose rebellion was kindled by hunger, but it was also limited by the social organisation of the army.”翻译为中文","output":"王室对武装力量垄断的实施不仅要求王室财政力量的真正普及，还要求国际军事发展——正如我们下面所示。在当前背景下，有两个方面特别重要：一方面是火炮和防御工事的发展，另一方面是常备军的建立。许多国家还有一个额外因素是设立战争部（法国于1758年设立）和只负责军事的特殊行政职位。 当亨利三世在1572-1573年对胡格诺派发起进攻、亲自指挥王家军队时，他让西皮奥·维尔加诺跟随他，就对拉罗谢尔的围城提出建议。这位意大利专家是明智之选，因为他几年前就组织了那里防御工事的改进。当时，雇佣意大利人、西班牙人或荷兰工程师在法国是常态。除了非常具体的任务外，他们通常还受命于设立当地的“学校”。在17世纪初，“法国”只拥有四名本国工程师。一百年后，王室服务的工程师有三百人。到了这个时候，“法国学派”的工程师，如今已声名远扬，也在外国宫廷服务。从17世纪后半叶开始，法国就有大量申请工程师职位的人。潜在的候选人经常在国王的战争中服役为“志愿工程师”，希望——通常是徒劳的——通过这种方式推荐自己获得长期工作。那些成功成为国王陛下的常规工程师的人在瓦宾的领导下，为王国边境建立了规律的防御工事带。 工程学的发展改变了战争的进行方式，也改变了成功主张统治权的物质前提条件。因为围城战的高成本有利于旨在王权普及的策略。 正如这场争夺统治权的武装竞争促进了武器破坏力的增加和防御技术相应的提高一样，它也促进了军事训练的发明。这种新的社会技术首先在荷兰引入，在三十年战争中随之传遍欧洲。汉斯·德尔布鲁克——我们欠他解释社会形式、士兵的社会组织、军事技术和战术之间联系的——如此描述这种新的社会技术：“这些训练创造了纪律，纪律使得训练的准确性和精确性成为可能，这些训练被不断地进一步追求，把个体视为几乎可以任意替换的机器零件。即使是那些最初被公然欺骗或粗暴力量强行征募的人，往往也会习惯于这种生活，在更大或较小程度上将其视为表达他们分队精神和荣誉的方式。” 据安德烈·科尔维西耶所说，早在16世纪，中世纪的战士就被士兵所取代了。但只有在将训练作为军事生活结构特征引入后，德尔布鲁克认为，拥有永久雇佣条件的军事机构才发展成为常备军。这种新的社会形式是17世纪的发明。它也是抽象“劳动”发展的第一个社会场所，将个体工人转变为社会机器的可替换的“齿轮”。军事训练的基本原理起初是为了在战斗中不停地重新装填火枪。不过，很快就变得清楚，通过定期系统的训练，可以让被强制征募的农民和工匠的儿子、宁愿选择军事服务而不是其他惩罚的囚犯，以及被捕获的“流浪者”变成士兵，使得他们的出身、方言和生活方式的差异与他们的共同职业相比失去了意义。 连同特定行政部门的建立，训练实践是“军事”与“平民”逐渐分离的结构前提之一。在旧制度结束时，法国这种区分仍处于早期阶段。从事时间肯定变得更长了。对于三十年战争时期，罗伯特·卡博什根据在旅馆接受的记录，确定了相当数量的士兵——大约20%的被分析者（其中大多数来自北部省份）——服役超过十三年，超过40%的人超过十年。这些是终身服役的明显迹象，即使有时会额外增加几年作为奖金。此外，在17世纪，几乎不存在军营。士兵要么在露天驻扎，要么被安置在私人住户中。在旧制度下，几乎没有什么特权比免除驻扎更迫切地被请求了。这种安排不仅不便，对许多人来说也涉及巨大的财务负担。在18世纪的过程中，许多城市正是为了免除士兵驻扎在市民家中而建造了军营。但在西班牙继承战争期间，当军队中有许多被强制征募的新兵时，在乡村和城镇，士兵被安置在私人住宅中仍然是典型和常见的。因此，许多人熟悉士兵的生活条件，这可能解释了为什么许多人愿意帮助那时也有很多的逃兵。 从皇冠派遣监督官到省份，使行政管理更有效、更受控制以来，军人对平民的暴力袭击减少了（尽管并非在所有地方）；被解雇的外籍雇佣兵的抢劫行动也变得更加罕见了。 常备军主要应由志愿者组成。实际上，在1692年至少在形式上禁止了强制征兵。然后签订了为期八年的合同。在服役期间和服役后的一年内，士兵免除了人头税，这一方面使他们处于与贵族相似的位置，另一方面也为皇冠节省了他们的薪水。有时，虽然不如之前假设的那么普遍，如果囚犯愿意加入军队，他们会被赦免；然而，曾被打上烙印的前走私船奴隶不被军队接受，尽管流浪汉经常被接受。一名普通士兵的薪酬与一名在适度受尊敬的行业中的学徒相当。由外国士兵组成的连队获得更高的报酬，但也受到更严格的纪律限制。 反复尝试将皇家民兵转变为志愿力量。因为这些尝试失败了，民兵实际上在1690年代的四年期间被废除。当战争再次开始时，民兵基于抽签的基础上进行了重新组织。某些群体被免除服役，有些地区要求的士兵相对较少。许多被抽中的人付钱给替代者。官方上，民兵的服务仅限于在要塞中的警卫任务，但在战时，整个师可能会被“并入”常规军队。在西班牙继承战争（1701-1713）期间，这种“并入”在民兵被召集时立即发生。而且，三年的服役期并没有遵守。据科尔维西耶说，在1708-1712年间，没有一个民兵在其服役期结束后被解散。 1702年，法国皇冠麾下共有220,000名士兵。一年后，这一数字上升到约300,000，比任何欧洲王国都要多。这庞大的军事力量，然而，并不能简单转化为内部政府的实力。由于战争的目的不是防御入侵者，而是主张王室权利，许多人不明白为什么他们应该冒着自己或他们儿子的生命危险，容忍驻扎并支付越来越高的税收。军事滥用加剧了这种不情愿。然而，正是在战时，皇冠几乎不可能让团队随时准备好以镇压可能的骚乱。他们的镇压力量限于惩罚性远征——尽管这些通常足够严酷。只要可能，外籍雇佣兵就会被用于此类行动。罗杰·梅特姆警告不要高估皇冠实施其政策的武装能力。即使我们考虑到西班牙继承战争带来的巨大财政和直接军事负担，这段时间出现的骚乱和抗议几乎不可能被视为对统治体系的威胁。相反，起义是一种常见的现象，一个对整个人口阶层否认其他表达其利益机会的统治行为。 对于100年后路易十六的统治时期，J.F. Bosher对路易十四统治期间的罗杰·梅特姆的评价持有不同的看法，他认为皇冠的镇压潜力非常广泛。他指的是拥有150,000人的常规军队，一个大型地方警察部队（马歇尔警察队），75,000名民兵（尽管从一个十年到下一个十年这些人没有被召集，甚至没有接受训练），以及至少有7,000名士兵的皇家卫队团。然而，1789年夏秋的事件清楚地表明，皇冠的军事潜力不能仅以部队实力来衡量，更不用说官方报告的数字了。政府对镇压手段的支配力不仅受到士兵对被用作警察力量对付因饥饿引发叛乱的人民的潜在和某些情况下的实际抵抗的限制，而且还受到军队的社会组织的限制。"},{"instruction":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息:

提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。

情况3：如果没有开始时间，只有截止时间，则格式为:\\"time\\":\\"即日起 ~ 2024-5-1 23:59:59\\"。 情况3例子：自票券到账之日起3天（3*24小时）内有效，票券每日承兑时间10:00:00-23:59:59，最迟承兑时间不得晚于2024年3月31日23:59:59。 关于优惠活动状态state的详细要求: 根据time算出活动结束时间，与“当前时间”进行比较判断，如果当前时间大于等于活动结束时间，则为值2，当前时间小于活动结束时间，则值为1，无法判断则值为0，默认值为0 关于支付场景scene包括: 1、生活缴费(如：话费、水费、煤气费、电费) 2、影票 3、信用卡还款 4、餐饮美食 5、罚没 6、充电(如汽车充电) 7、机票 8、车票 9、船票 10、酒店住宿 11、租车 12、门票 13、购车

情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=m，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=m，total=0； 优惠次数限制逻辑例子： 某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。

提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。

情况3：如果没有开始时间，只有截止时间，则格式为:\\"time\\":\\"即日起 ~ 2024-5-1 23:59:59\\"。 情况3例子：自票券到账之日起3天（3*24小时）内有效，票券每日承兑时间10:00:00-23:59:59，最迟承兑时间不得晚于2024年3月31日23:59:59。 关于优惠活动状态state的详细要求: 根据time算出活动结束时间，与“当前时间”进行比较判断，如果当前时间大于等于活动结束时间，则为值2，当前时间小于活动结束时间，则值为1，无法判断则值为0，默认值为0 关于支付场景scene包括: 1、生活缴费(如：话费、水费、煤气费、电费) 2、影票 3、信用卡还款 4、餐饮美食 5、罚没 6、充电(如汽车充电) 7、机票 8、车票 9、船票 10、酒店住宿 11、租车 12、门票 13、购车

情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=m，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=m，total=0； 优惠次数限制逻辑例子： 某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 11:50:10

根据time算出活动结束时间，与“当前时间”进行比较判断，如果当前时间大于等于活动结束时间，则为值2，当前时间小于活动结束时间，则值为1，无法判断则值为0，默认值为0 关于支付场景scene包括: 1、生活缴费(如：话费、水费、煤气费、电费) 2、影票 3、信用卡还款 4、餐饮美食 5、罚没 6、充电(如汽车充电) 7、机票 8、车票 9、船票 10、酒店住宿 11、租车 12、门票 13、购车 14、购房 15、网络购物 16、商超购物 17、中石油加油 18、中石化加油 19、车辆洗护 20、汽车保养 21、地铁 22、公交 23、共享单车 24、共享汽车 25、淘宝天猫 26、京东 27、唯品会 28、拼多多 29、抖音 30、快手 不符合以上归类的，默认为\\"指定消费\\" 关于优惠活动daily、weekly、monthly、total的详细要求: 情况1，如只提到了活动周期内总限n次，则令daily=0，weekly=0，monthly=0，total=n； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=0，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=0，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=m，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=m，total=0； 优惠次数限制逻辑例子： 某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 11:52:09

提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。

情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=0，monthly=m，total=0； 情况1，如只提到了每日限n次，周限x次，月限m次，则令daily=n，weekly=x，monthly=m，total=0； 优惠次数限制逻辑例子： 某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 11:55:13

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 12:01:12
