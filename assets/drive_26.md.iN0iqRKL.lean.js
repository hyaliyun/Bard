Spanish is official in all of Spain, whereas Valencian is official in the Valencian Country, as well as in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, where it receives the name of Catalan. Despite the differentiated denomination, the distinct dialectal traits and political tension between Catalonia and the Valencian Country, Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible and are considered two varieties of the same language. Valencian has been historically repressed in favour of Spanish. The effects have been more noticeable in the city proper, whereas the language has remained active in the rural and metropolitan areas. After the Castille-Aragon unification, a Spanish-speaking elite established itself in the city. In more recent history, the establishment of Franco's military and administrative apparatus in Valencia further excluded Valencian from public life. Valencian recovered its official status, prestige and use in education after the transition to democracy in 1978. However, due to industrialisation in recent decades, Valencia has attracted immigration from other regions in Spain, and hence there is also a demographic factor for its declining social use. Due to a combination of these reasons, Valencia has become the bastion of anti-Catalan blaverism, which celebrates Valencian as merely folkloric, but rejects the existing standard which was adapted from Catalan orthography. Spanish is currently the predominant language in the city proper but, thanks to the education system, most Valencians have basic knowledge of both Spanish and Valencian, and either can be used in the city. Valencia is therefore the second biggest Catalan-speaking city after Barcelona. Institutional buildings and streets are named in Valencian. The city is also home to many pro-Valencian political and civil organisations. Furthermore, education entirely in Valencian is offered in more than 70 state-owned schools in the city, as well as by the University of Valencia across all disciplines. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): When did Valencian regain its offical status?","output":"Valencian regained its official status after the transition to democracy in Spain in 1978. The Spanish Constitution of 1978, which marked a major turning point in Spain's history and signaled the country's transition from a dictatorship to a democratic constitutional monarchy, recognized and guaranteed the right to use and learn regional languages throughout the Spanish State. Then, the Statute of Autonomy of Valencia, approved in 1982, established Valencian as the official language in the Valencian Community, alongside Spanish. This marked the formal end of the repression of Valencian and began a period of language standardization and normalization, aimed at recovering its use in education, public administration, media, and cultural and social life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? Who didn't want the author to pluck grey hairs?

Here is a hypothesis: It lowers the drive to save money for retirement.

To establish the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's break down the components and analyze them. Premise: Most importantly, it reduces the incentive to save for retirement. This statement indicates that there is a significant factor (referred to as \\"it\\") that has the effect of diminishing the motivation for people to save money towards their retirement. In other words, this specific circumstance or action leads to a decrease in the attractiveness of setting aside financial resources for retirement purposes. Hypothesis: It lowers the drive to save money for retirement. This statement is essentially rephrasing the premise by indicating that the same factor (again, \\"it\\") is causing people to have a reduced desire or motivation to save money for their retirement. The hypothesis directly aligns with the premise – it indicates that the same circumstance or action is responsible for the decreased motivation to save for retirement. To conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true, we can analyze the logical structure and coherence between the two statements: 1. Both the premise and the hypothesis are focused on the same factor/circumstance (\\"it\\") that impacts savings behavior related to retirement. 2. Both statements share the effect of that factor/circumstance on people's motivation to save for retirement. 3. The rephrasing of the premise in the hypothesis uses slightly different terminology but maintains the same overall meaning - reducing the incentive to save for retirement equates to lowering the drive to save money for retirement. Based on these factors, we can establish that if the premise is valid and accurate, so is the hypothesis. The statements share a consistent focus on the specific effect of the factor in question (reducing motivation to save for retirement), and the logical coherence in their structure supports the validity of the hypothesis when the premise is true."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: It's the end of the line for Roadrunner, a first-of-its-kind collection of processors that once reigned as the world's fastest supercomputer.      This undated handout photo provided by IBM shows lead engineer Don Grice of IBM inspecting the world's fastest computer, nicknamed \\"Roadrunner\\", in the company's Poughkeepsie, N.Y. plant. It's the end... (Associated Press)      The 121 million supercomputer, housed at one of the premier U.S. nuclear weapons research laboratories in northern New Mexico, will be decommissioned Sunday.      The reason? The world of supercomputing is evolving and Roadrunner has been replaced with something smaller, faster, more energy efficient and cheaper. Still, officials at Los Alamos National Laboratory say it's among the 25 fastest supercomputers in the world.      \\"Roadrunner got everyone thinking in new ways about how to build and use a supercomputer,\\" said Gary Grider, who works in the lab's high performance computing division. \\"Specialized processors are being included in new ways on new systems and being used in novel ways. Our demonstration with Roadrunner caused everyone to pay attention.\\"      In 2008, Roadrunner was first to break the elusive petaflop barrier by processing just over a quadrillion mathematical calculations per second.      Los Alamos teamed up with IBM to build Roadrunner from commercially available parts. They ended up with 278 refrigerator-size racks filled with two different types of processors, all linked together by 55 miles (89 kilometers) of fiber optic cable. It took nearly two dozen tractor trailer trucks to deliver the supercomputer from New York to northern New Mexico.      The supercomputer has been used over the last five years to model viruses and unseen parts of the universe, to better understand lasers and for nuclear weapons work. That includes simulations aimed at ensuring the safety and reliability of the aging U.S. arsenal.      As part of the U.S. nuclear stockpile stewardship program, researchers used Roadrunner's high-speed calculation capabilities to unravel some of the mysteries of energy flow in weapons.      Los Alamos has been helping pioneer novel computer systems for decades. In 1976, the lab helped with the development of the Cray-1. In 1993, the lab held the fastest supercomputer title with the Thinking Machine CM-5.      \\"And to think of where we're going to be in the next 10 to 15 years, it's just mindboggling,\\" said lab spokesman Kevin Roark.      Right now, Los Alamos _ along with scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California _ is using a supercomputer dubbed Cielo. Installed in 2010, it's slightly faster than Roadrunner, takes up less space and came in at just under 54 million.      Roark said in the next 10 to 20 years, it's expected that the world's supercomputers will be capable of breaking the exascale barrier, or one quintillion calculations per second.      There will be no ceremony when Roadrunner is switched off Sunday, but lab officials said researchers will spend the next month experimenting with its operating system and techniques for compressing memory before dismantling begins. They say the work could help guide the design of future supercomputers.      ___      Follow Susan Montoya Bryan on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/susanmbryanNM ||||| Created to monitor the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, the IBM supercomputer was the first to break the petaflop barrier.      The Roadrunner supercomputer at Los Alamos National Laboratory. (Credit: Los Alamos National Laboratory)      Four years ago, Roadrunner was the world's fastest supercomputer. But it has lost a step on today's speed leaders and will be shut down today in preparation for dismantling.      Created in 2008 to monitor the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, the IBM supercomputer was the first system to break the petaflop barrier, hitting 1.026 petaflops shortly after its installation at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. (1 petaflop is equal to a quadrillion, or one thousand trillion, calculations per second.) It would ultimately sit atop of the Top500 supercomputers list three times.      In its five years of operation, the Roadrunner was the \\"workhorse\\" behind the National Nuclear Security Administration's Advanced Simulation and Computing program, providing key computer simulations for the Stockpile Stewardship Program.      \\"Roadrunner exemplified stockpile stewardship: an excellent team integrating complex codes with advanced computing architectures to ensure a safe, secure and effective deterrent,\\" Chris Deeney, NNSA assistant deputy administrator for Stockpile Stewardship, said in a statement. \\"Roadrunner and its successes have positioned us well to weather the technology changes on the HPC horizon as we implement stockpile modernization without recourse to underground testing.\\"      Based on the IBM QS22 blades and x86 chips from Advanced Micro Devices, the 121 million Roadrunner was the world's first hybrid supercomputer. In total, Roadrunner took up 278 refrigerator-size server racks, connecting 6,562 dual-core AMD Opteron and 12,240 Cell chips -- advanced versions of the same processor that powers Sony's PlayStation 3.      \\"Roadrunner was a truly pioneering idea,\\" Gary Grider, of the Laboratory's High Performance Computing Division, said in a statement. \\"Roadrunner got everyone thinking in new ways about how to build and use a supercomputer. Specialized processors are being included in new ways on new systems, and being used in novel ways. Our demonstration with Roadrunner caused everyone to pay attention.\\"      While Roadrunner is still one of the world's 30 fastest supercomputers, advances in chip design have left it behind. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Titan supercomputer is currently the speed leader, clocking in at 17.59 petaflops per second. Built by Cray, the system is composed of 18,688 nodes, with each containing a 16-core AMD Opteron processor and an Nvidia Tesla GPU.      In addition to Roadrunner's weapons-monitoring duties, it also helped map the HIV genetic tree and simulated the Big Bang in an attempt to better understand dark matter, calculating the physics behind 64 billion proto-galaxies, each about the size of a billion of our suns.      Before Roadrunner is dismantled, researchers will have about a month to perform experiments on the operating system's memory compression techniques to aid design of future supercomputers.      \\"Even in death, we are trying to learn from Roadrunner,\\" Grider said. \\"These are things we never could try while Roadrunner was running production problems.\\" ||||| Five years ago, an IBM-built supercomputer designed to model the decay of the US nuclear weapons arsenal was clocked at speeds no computer in the history of Earth had ever reached. At more than one quadrillion floating point operations per second (that's a million billion, or a \\"petaflop\\"), the aptly named Roadrunner was so far ahead of the competition that it earned the #1 slot on the Top 500 supercomputer list in June 2008, November 2008, and one last time in June 2009.      Today, that computer has been declared obsolete and it's being taken offline. Based at the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, Roadrunner will be studied for a while and then ultimately dismantled. While the computer is still one of the 22 fastest in the world, it isn't energy-efficient enough to make the power bill worth it.      \\"During its five operational years, Roadrunner, part of the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) program to provide key computer simulations for the Stockpile Stewardship Program, was a workhorse system providing computing power for stewardship of the US nuclear deterrent, and in its early shakedown phase, a wide variety of unclassified science,\\" Los Alamos lab said in an announcement Friday.      Costing more than 120 million, Roadrunner's 296 server racks covering 6,000 square feet were connected with InfiniBand and contained 122,400 processor cores. The hybrid architecture used IBM PowerXCell 8i CPUs (an enhanced version of the Sony PlayStation 3 processor) and AMD Opteron dual-core processors. The AMD processors handled basic tasks, with the Cell CPUs \\"taking on the most computationally intense parts of a calculation—thus acting as a computational accelerator,\\" Los Alamos wrote.      \\"Although other hybrid computers existed, none were at the supercomputing scale,\\" Los Alamos said. \\"Many doubted that a hybrid supercomputer could work, so for Los Alamos and IBM, Roadrunner was a leap of faith… As part of its Stockpile Stewardship work, Roadrunner took on a difficult, long-standing gap in understanding of energy flow in a weapon and its relation to weapon yield.\\"      Roadrunner lost its world's-fastest title in November 2009 to Jaguar, another Department of Energy supercomputer combining AMD Opterons with Cray processors. Jaguar hit 1.76 petaflops to take the title, and it still exists as part of an even newer cluster called Titan. Titan took the top spot in the November 2012 supercomputers list with a speed of 17.6 petaflops.      Supercomputing researchers are now looking toward exascale speeds—1,000 times faster than a petaflop—but major advances in energy efficiency and price-performance are necessary.      Petaflop machines aren't automatically obsolete—a petaflop is still speedy enough to crack the top 25 fastest supercomputers. Roadrunner is thus still capable of performing scientific work at mind-boggling speeds, but has been surpassed by competitors in terms of energy efficiency. For example, in the November 2012 ratings Roadrunner required 2,345 kilowatts to hit 1.042 petaflops and a world ranking of #22. The supercomputer at #21 required only 1,177 kilowatts, and #23 (clocked at 1.035 petaflops) required just 493 kilowatts.      \\"Future supercomputers will need to improve on Roadrunner’s energy efficiency to make the power bill affordable,\\" Los Alamos wrote. \\"Future supercomputers will also need new solutions for handling and storing the vast amounts of data involved in such massive calculations.\\"      After Roadrunner is shut off today, researchers will spend a month doing experiments on \\"operating system memory compression techniques for an ASC relevant application, and optimized data routing to help guide the design of future capacity cluster computers.\\" After that, the cluster will finally be dismantled, the end of the world's first petaflop supercomputer. |||||Summary:","output":"Roadrunner was a very special computer called a supercomputer, which was very fast and powerful. It was built to help do important work like studying how to keep people safe from nuclear weapons. Roadrunner used to be the fastest supercomputer in the world, but now there are other, faster ones. So, the people in charge have decided to stop using Roadrunner and learn from its design to make even better supercomputers in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Jackie Chan is at a comic convention. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, we cannot conclusively confirm the given hypothesis is true if the premise is true. It is certainly possible that Jackie Chan could be signing autographs for eager fans at a comic convention, but it is important to note that there are other plausible scenarios and locations where such an event could take place. The premise states that actor Jackie Chan is signing autographs for eager fans. This premise is quite general and does not limit the context or location of the autograph signing session. Jackie Chan, given his global popularity and long career in the entertainment industry, could be signing autographs in various contexts such as meet-and-greets, movie premieres, charity events, promotional events, or even randomly encountering fans on the street. The hypothesis suggests that Jackie Chan is at a comic convention. While it is a feasible assumption, it still remains one of the many possible places he could be. The fact that he is signing autographs for his fans does not automatically confirm that he is at a comic convention; the autograph signing could take place anywhere. To conclusively confirm the hypothesis, other supporting evidence or information would be necessary, such as Jackie Chan explicitly mentioning his presence at a convention or photographic evidence showing him at a comic convention while signing autographs for fans.

Solve this problem.","output":"Alright kiddo, let's solve this little math puzzle together! We want to find out the value of z. Here is our math problem:  -121 * z + 287 = -80 * z Our goal is to get all the z's on one side of the equation, so we can find out what z is. Let's start by adding 80 * z to both sides: -121 * z + 80 * z + 287 = (-80 * z) + 80 * z This simplifies to: -41 * z + 287 = 0 Now, we're going to get z all by itself. To do that, we need to get rid of the 287. So, we'll subtract 287 from both sides: -41 * z = -287 Almost there! Now, to find the value of z, we just need to divide both sides by -41: z = -287 / -41 When we do the division, we find out that: z = 7 So there you go! The value of z is 7.

What is the answer for the question: What number did the song that was the first completed for Blonde on Blonde reach on the UK charts? from the following article ?  \\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\"When Dylan arrived at the studio on January 25, 1966, he had yet to work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on Blonde on Blonde's first side. With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin's piano for binding the song together: \\"At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the keyboard, half Gershwin, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song's tension.\\"\\"One of Us Must Know\\" is a straightforward account of a burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: \\"I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You don't have to take it so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that's all.\\" \\"One of Us Must Know\\" was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".\\"?

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: John Owen Brennan (born September 22, 1955) was the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from March 2013 to January 2017. He served as chief counterterrorism advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama; his title was Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, and Assistant to the President. His responsibilities included overseeing plans to protect the country from terrorism and respond to natural disasters, and he met with the President daily. Previously, he advised President Obama on foreign policy and intelligence issues during the 2008 presidential campaign and transition. Brennan began his CIA career as an analyst and spent 25 years with the agency. He was a daily intelligence briefer for President Bill Clinton. In 1996, he was CIA station chief in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia when the Khobar Towers bombing killed 19 U.S. servicemen. In 1999, he was appointed chief of staff to George Tenet, then-Director of the CIA. Brennan became deputy executive director of the CIA in March 2001. He was director of the newly created Terrorist Threat Integration Center from 2003 to 2004, an office that sifted through and compiled information for President Bush's daily top secret intelligence briefings and employed the services of analysts from a dozen U.S. agencies and entities. One of the controversies in his career involves the distribution of intelligence to the Bush White House that helped lead to an \\"Orange Terror Alert\\", in late 2003. The intelligence, which purported to list terror targets, was highly controversial within the CIA and was later discredited. An Obama administration official does not dispute that Brennan distributed the intelligence during the Bush era but said Brennan passed it along because that was his job. His last post within the Intelligence Community was as director of the National Counterterrorism Center in 2004 and 2005, which incorporated information on terrorist activities across U.S. agencies.  Brennan then left government service for a few years, becoming Chairman of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) and the CEO of The Analysis Corporation (TAC). He continued to lead TAC after its acquisition by Global Strategies Group in 2007 and its growth as the Global Intelligence Solutions division of Global's North American technology business GTEC, before returning to government service with the Obama administration as Homeland Security Advisor on January 20, 2009.  On January 7, 2013, Brennan was nominated by President Barack Obama to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  In September 2017, Brennan was named a Distinguished Non-Resident Scholar at The University of Texas at Austin, where he also acts as a Senior Advisor to the University's Intelligence Studies Project. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in the article about John Owen Brennan: 1.

To provide a complete answer, one should clarify that the channel number for the SEC Network varies depending on the cable or satellite provider and the location of the viewer. Here is an extended and detailed response to the question: \\"The SEC Network is a sports television channel operated by ESPN that focuses on the coverage of sports programs and events related to the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The channel does typically air games in the noon Eastern time slot, formerly the domain of the Raycom Sports SEC game of the week. However, the specific channel number for the SEC Network is not universal, as it varies depending on the viewer's cable or satellite provider and location. For example, in the United States, you can typically find the SEC Network on channels such as: - AT&T U-Verse: Channel 607 (HD) and Channel 1607 (HD) - DirecTV: Channel 611 (HD) - DISH Network: Channel 408 (HD/SD) and Channel 404 (Hopper) - Spectrum: Channel 371 (HD) in some locations - Comcast XFINITY: Channel 725 (HD) and Channel 587 (SD) in some locations To find the exact channel number for the SEC Network based on your cable or satellite provider and location, I recommend checking your provider's channel guide or visiting their official website. Alternatively, you can access the SEC Network through authorized online streaming services, such as ESPN.com/watch, the ESPN app, or the TV provider's streaming service.\\" In conclusion, the given answer is not sufficient for providing accurate information about the SEC Network's channel number, but it does provide some insight into the network's programming schedule. By enhancing the information with more specific channel details and providing a method for locating the channel, you would deliver a more comprehensive and helpful answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

Question: What is the name of the person whose orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade, according to McVeagh?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the...

Here is a news article: Back fire: TomTom sold user data to police, motorists then targeted with speed traps      Following reports that TomTom had sold traffic data collected from GPS device users to police who then used it to determine locations for speed traps, the company has issued a statement and video in an effort to appease angry customers.      In the video, TomTom CEO Harold Goodijn stresses that the tracking of its devices is voluntary and that customers can choose not to allow it. He also says the data is provided anonymously, and is valuable information the company uses to improve the guidance of its devices, by identifying problem areas and routing customers around them.      TomTom says the company has provided this data to police departments and other authorities to help them identify congested areas for safety reasons and to help determine where road capacity needs to be increased. Mr. Goodijn says TomTom had been unaware Dutch police were using the data to choose locations for speed traps and that the company would prevent that type of usage in the future.      With revenue from standalone GPS devices falling as more motorists turn to their smart phones for navigation, it is not surprising that TomTom is looking for other sources of income. And traffic information that might help identify overloaded roads, danger spots, and help prevent crashes can hardly be looked at as anything but a good thing, particularly if lives are saved--so long as privacy is protected.      Whether it is a good or bad thing to use that data as a tool to capture speeders who may well be endangering other motorists is an interesting question. Is TomTom serving its customers, community safety, or its business demands. Can all three be addressed fairly?      What do you think?       ||||| AFP/Getty Images Dutch police used TomTom data to locate speed traps      The use by police of navigation equipment maker TomTom NV’s data to site road speed cameras looks to have been limited to the Netherlands, but the company still has to lay out more clearly how it protects the privacy of its customers, Chief Executive Harold Goddijn said.      Last week, it emerged that police in certain Dutch provinces used data collected by TomTom to better plan where to locate speed traps, causing an outcry in the country and forcing Mr. Goddijn to apologize in e-mails to its customers and in full-page advertisements in Dutch newspapers.      The company can’t guarantee “a hundred percent” that the issue was limited to its home market of the Netherlands, but there is no indication right now that it occurred in other countries, Mr. Goddijn told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Monday.      Meanwhile, the company’s customers appreciated its “open communication” over the issue and doesn’t expect its reputation to be harmed, Mr. Goddijn said.      TomTom collects anonymous data from owners of high-end navigation devices and those on Vodafone’s local network to provide information about individual driving behavior, which it then uses to power real-time information services for its customers, including the location of speed cameras.      TomTom also sells the data, which includes speed profiles, to governments throughout Europe as well as the U.S. and Canada. The province of Ontario, for example, used TomTom data to refine the evacuation plan for the city of Toronto.      When it emerged that Dutch police were making use of the data to position speed cameras more efficiently “it was a sobering experience,” Mr. Goddijn said, adding that TomTom has more work to do to explain how it protects customers’ privacy.      “We fully comply with strict privacy laws”      Still, the issue was “unjustifiably linked to other data scandals,” he said.      “From a strictly legal standpoint we didn’t make a mistake, as we fully comply with strict privacy laws.”      Consumers are becoming increasingly sensitive to how companies use their personal data; Apple just last week, responding to mounting criticism and concern over privacy, denied claims that it tracks its iPhone users but acknowledged flaws in how it collects and stores data required for location-based services. Google’s Street View, which allows users to virtually tour locations on a map, has also sparked intense debate about privacy across Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere.      In the Netherlands, TomTom sold its data to a third party company which resold it to the Dutch government, from where it finally ended up in the hands of provincial and local policy authorities, Mr. Goddijn said.      Mr. Goddijn declined to say how much money TomTom makes from selling data to governments. “The amount is not huge but meaningful,” he said.      As a result of the furore, TomTom is working to amend its license agreements to ban police from using its data, a time-consuming task that means the company has to review every existing contract.      For new contracts with governments, rules that bar police from using TomTom’s speed profiles will come into effect within the next two weeks, Mr. Goddijn said.      TomTom uses the data it collects to create real-time information services it sells to its customers—including information about the location of speed cameras. An annual subscription costs €50 in the Netherlands but pricing varies from country to country.      Such added-value, high-margin services are becoming increasingly important for TomTom which last week lowered its full year sales outlook as the market for personal navigation devices continues to shrink. Personal navigation systems, or PNDs, are still TomTom’s core product, generating slightly less than 50% of its overall revenue.      Last week Mr. Goddijn told Dow Jones Newswires he sees growing potential for new services and doesn’t expect sales to be hurt by the recent controversy.

Their personnel changed and rotated with each album and tour.  - Hip hop is a subcultural art movement that was formed during the early 1970s primarily by African-American and Afro Puerto Rican youths residing in the South Bronx in New York City. Art historian Robert Farris Thompson describes the demographics of the youth that characterize the South Bronx in the early 1970s as \\"English-speaking blacks from Barbados\\" like Grandmaster Flash, \\"black Jamaicans\\" like DJ Kool Herc, \\"thousands of Nuyoricans\\", who introduced the rhythms from Salsa (music), as well as Afro conga and bonga drums, as well as many who emulated the sounds of Tito Puente and Willie Colón with existing styles of musical styles from jazz to funk associated with African Americans prior to the 1970s. Hip hop music became popular outside of the African-American community in the late 1980s. After the rise of new media platforms and Web 2.0 technology of the Internet, fans would primarily consume the musical genre through social networking sites (SNS) beginning with Myspace evolving to notable mobile apps like YouTube, Worldstarhiphop, SoundCloud, and Spotify.  - \\"The Humpty Dance\\" is a song by Digital Underground, which was featured on their debut album \\"Sex Packets\\". The single climbed to #11 on the pop charts, #7 on the R&B charts, and #1 on the Billboard Rap Singles chart. The single is sung by Shock G's alter ego, \\"Humpty Hump\\", marking the character's second musical appearance; the first being Digital Underground's \\"Doowutchyalike,\\" a pre-album video-single released in the spring of 1989.

In the song's video, a young Tupac Shakur is visible in the background.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - Alternative hip hop (also known as alternative rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that encompasses the wide range of styles of hip hop that have not become identified as mainstream. AllMusic defines it as follows: \\"Alternative rap refers to hip hop groups that tend not to conform to any of the traditional forms of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, pop, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres  drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronic, and even folk.\\"  - 2Pacalypse Now is the debut studio album by American rapper 2Pac. It was released on November 12, 1991, by Interscope Records and EastWest Records America. Less polished than it later proceed with his studio album, \\"2Pacalypse Now\\", which is 2Pac's commentary on contemporary social issues facing American society such as racism, police brutality, poverty, black on black crime, and teenage pregnancy, some issues giving a lyrical glimpse into the world of a young black man on the urban streets of the United States.

Their albums contained cameos by many of the Digital Underground crew, including Shock G (as himself, Humpty Hump, and the Piano Man) and 2Pac. The group gave a more raw, hardcore feel than the funky styles that typical Digital Underground albums projected, pulling away from their Funkadelic and Parliament roots. Tracks put out under the Raw Fusion name tended to be more experiemntal and had less of the flow that was typically found in other tracks to which Money-B and DJ Fuze had contributed. The group released two albums before disbanding.  - An alter ego (Latin, \\"the other I\\") is a second self, which is believed to be distinct from a person's normal or original personality. A person who has an alter ego is said to lead a double life. The term appeared in common usage in the early 19th century when dissociative identity disorder was first described by psychologists. Cicero first coined the term as part of his philosophical construct in 1st century Rome, but he described it as \\"a second self, a trusted friend\\".  - Gregory Jacobs, commonly known by his stage name Shock G (as well as by his alter ego Humpty Hump) is an American musician and rapper, known as the lead vocalist for the hip hop group Digital Underground.

However, things did not start well for Carr as he threw an interception on his first pass of the day and the Chargers took over at the Raider 30-yard line. the defense held the Chargers to a field goal attempt from 48 yards out which was no good. The Raiders took advantage and moved the ball down the field before Carr hit Michael Crabtree from 23 yards out to give the Raiders a 7-0 lead. Neither team could muster much offense until midway through the second quarter when the Chargers moved 82 yards and scored on a Melvin Gordon touchdown run from one yard out to tie the game. With, 1:34 remaining in the half, the Raiders moved into Charger territory and connected on a Giorgio Tavecchio 44-yard field goal as time expired to give the Raiders a 10-7 lead at the half. On their first possession of the second half, the Raiders moved deep into Charger territory, but managed no points as Carr was intercepted for the second time in the game. The teams exchanged punts and fumbles as the game moved into the fourth quarter. The Chargers finally managed some offense as Philip Rivers hit Melvin Gordon for a six-yard touchdown pass to give the Charger at 14-10 lead. On their ensuing possession, Cordarrelle Patterson took the ball on an end around and scampered 47 yards for a touchdown. Giorgio Tavecchio would, however, miss the ensuing point after to leave the Raider lead at two points, 16-14. After exchanging punts, the Chargers took over with 4:09 remaining in the game. Rivers hit Hunter Henry for a 23-yard pass play to move the ball into Raider territory. with less than two minutes remaining, the Chargers moved the ball to the Raider 10 yard line and lined up for the game-winning field goal with three second left in the game. The field goal was good and the Raiders suffered their fourth straight loss, falling to 2-4 on the season. The four losses through six gamed equaled the number of losses they suffered the entire season the prior year. The Raider defense again struggled, giving up 343 total yards while the offense struggled as well, managing only 274 yards. Carr's two interceptions proved costly in his return.

Choose your answer from:  * no.  * yes.","output":"No, these two questions do not share the same meaning. The first question, \\"Why not to fear?\\" seems to be asking about the concepts or reasons for not being afraid in general. Fear is an emotional response to perceived threats and can sometimes be useful as it helps protect us from danger. However, it can also be irrational or unhelpful, and this question might be exploring ways to manage or overcome excessive fear. The second question, \\"Why do you fear animals?\\" deals more specifically with fear towards animals. People may experience fear of animals for different reasons, such as a fear of being harmed, bitten, or attacked. This might be spurred by past experiences, cultural beliefs, or simply a lack of understanding or exposure to animals. Here the focus is on the fear towards a particular group, which is different from discussing fear in general. So, while both questions explore the topic of fear, they approach it from distinct angles and inquire about different aspects.

These fungi are called dimorphic fungi , because they have “two forms.” For example, the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum , which causes the disease histoplasmosis, is thermally dimorphic; it has two forms that are dependent on temperature. In temperatures of about 25°C, it grows as a brownish mycelium, and looks like a mass of threads. At body temperature (37°C in humans), it grows as single, round yeast cells.

Read this article and answer this question For history prior to 1712, see Province of Carolina.King Charles II of England granted the Carolina charter in 1663 for land south of Virginia Colony and north of Spanish Florida. Charles II granted the land to eight Lords Proprietors in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660. Because the northern half of the colony differed significantly from the southern half, and because transportation and communication between the two settled regions was difficult, a separate deputy governor was named to administer the northern half of the colony starting in 1691. The division of the colony into North and South was completed at a meeting of the Lords Proprietors held at Craven House in London on December 7, 1710, although the same proprietors continued to control both colonies. The first Governor of the separate North Carolina Province was Edward Hyde. Unrest against the proprietors in South Carolina in 1719 led to the appointment of a royal governor in that colony by King George I, whereas the Lords Proprietor continued to appoint the governor of North Carolina.

The Jets played a rare road game at home, as they took on their intracity rivals (and stadium co-tenants), the New York Giants. Both offenses were slow to start through the first quarter, though the Jets' defense capitalized when Giants running back Brandon Jacobs fumbled at his own 11-yard line, which was picked up by safety Kerry Rhodes for a touchdown. The Jets had a chance to extend the lead later in the period, but Mike Nugent missed a 42-yard field goal. The Giants responded on the ensuing drive with an eight-yard touchdown by Derrick Ward. The deadlock was broken toward the end of the first half when Chad Pennington led the Jets on a 93-yard drive with less than two minutes in the half, ending on a 16-yard touchdown pass to Brad Smith. The Jets were able to tack on a 47-yard field goal by Nugent to end the half, after they got the ball back on an interception of Giants quarterback Eli Manning by Jonathan Vilma, taking a 17-7 lead into the locker room. The Giants went to work when they opened the second half, getting a 19-yard touchdown run from Jacobs to cut the Jets' lead to three. The lead was restored back to ten, however, when Leon Washington returned the ensuing kickoff 98&#160;yards for a touchdown. Later in the quarter, Manning led the Giants downfield and completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey for a touchdown. Pennington attempted to respond by leading the Jets deep into Giants territory early in the fourth quarter, but he floated a pass toward the end zone which was intercepted at the two-yard line by cornerback Aaron Ross. Despite the bad field position, Manning eventually found Plaxico Burress on a 53-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants ahead, 28-24. The Jets tried to get back ahead later in the period, but Pennington was intercepted again by Ross (Pennington's third of the afternoon), who took it 43&#160;yards for what was effectively the game-sealing touchdown.

Read this: In 2006, FIG introduced a new points system for Artistic gymnastics in which scores are no longer limited to 10 points. The system is used in the US for elite level competition. Unlike the old code of points, there are two separate scores, an execution score and a difficulty score. In the previous system, the \\"execution score\\" was the only score. It was and still is out of 10.00. During the gymnast's performance, the judges deduct this score only. A fall, on or off the event, is a 1.00 deduction, in elite level gymnastics. The introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change. The gymnast's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Connection bonuses are the most common deduction from a difficulty score, as it can be difficult to connect multiple flight elements. It is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly. The new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of the skills they perform as well as their execution. There is no maximum score for difficulty, as it can keep increasing as the difficulty of the skills increase.

Today, 14 staff attorneys, 26 office workers and 21 University of Memphis third- year law students work out of rented offices in the old Claridge Hotel building at 109 N. Main. Offices are spartan. There are no lush rugs or stylish furniture. The large table in the conference room is simple varnished wood. Offices are small and mostly plain, except for the eclectic mix of pop art, African statuary and neon that adorns litigation director Webb Brewer's space. Brewer, who has been at the agency 20 years, said there is a need for lawyers of all stripes to help with the problems of the poor. \\"The private bar could meet more of the need through pro bono work, but there are still cases that involve the systemic problems for low-income people that we would need to do,\\" said Brewer. \\"The legal system marketplace just doesn't serve low-income people too well, except in fee-generat-ing type cases,\\" Brewer said. \\"If a poor person gets run over by a bus, an attorney might take that case because they might be able to recover part of the damage award as attorney fees. But so many of the cases we handle have to do with basic rights and a decent life. There is just no profit motive.\\" Larry Pivnick, law professor at the University of Memphis Law School and director of political programs at MALS, said Legal Services is a great learning laboratory for law students. \\"There are thousands and thousands of people who have problems that never get an opportunity to appear in court,\\" Pivnick said. \\"Some people may not be particularly articulate. Courts have rules that clients don't always understand.\\" Brewer said a major focus of the agency's work involves housing. \\"Although a lot of our work is grant-driven, we find that the lack of safe and decent affordable housing and the prevalence of predatory lending are the biggest problems in our client population,\\" Brewer said, referring to clients such as James.

Mariupol, Ukraine (CNN)Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko declared a ceasefire went into effect at midnight Saturday local time (5 p.m. ET) between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian militants in the nation's east.  The separatist Donetsk People's Republic also announced the ceasefire.  But an apparent violation was reported less than 90 minutes after the ceasefire began when Ukraine's Anti-Terrorist Operation Command reported that a military post near Zolote in the Luhansk region has been shelled by mortars.  As a positive sign, CNN reporters in Ukraine reported the shelling quieted shortly after midnight.  The peace agreement signed in Minsk, Belarus, several days ago comes with many questions over how it will be implemented and whether it will stick. Mistrust is high on both sides, adding to the doubts.  The town of Debaltseve, a strategically located railroad hub in the east, is shaping up as a crucial piece of the ceasefire.  In his speech announcing the ceasefire, Poroshenko said Ukrainian troops control the town and warned militants to stay away.  \\"I think the fact of using the tense situation on the outskirts of Debaltseve by militants-terrorists-mercenaries poses a great threat, which can violate the ceasefire regime,\\" Poroshenko said. \\"I am warning all participants of the Minsk negotiations, including the Russian Federation, which identifies itself as the guarantor of the reached agreements.\\"  CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, reporting from the eastern town of Donetsk, said separatists claim to have encircled Debaltseve.  \\"Debaltseve will be a vital flashpoint for the hours ahead,\\" he said.

I have a habit of making mental errors; some funny, some not. This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: James noticed that people who communicate well have fewer problems.  Some people communicate easily with strangers, others need to talk with members of their own groups.  A religion is a type of group.  What do members of a religion have in common? - believe in god - talk to each other - pay bills - learn from each other - believe in ghosts  The best answer is Answer:","output":"Members of a religion have several commonalities that unite them as a group, and this shared understanding and belief system allows them to communicate effectively with one another. The best answer that encompasses the primary elements of what they have in common would be that they share beliefs in a higher power or divine entity, engage in discussions and interactions as part of their religious community, learn from each other, and often participate in financial support for their religious institutions. 1. Believe in a higher power or divine entity: Members of a religion typically share a belief in a higher power, whether it is a single god, multiple gods, or a divine presence that governs the universe and the lives of people. This belief in a higher power or divine entity is the foundation of their religious identity. 2. Engage in discussions and interactions as part of their religious community: Religion often emphasizes the importance of community, fellowship, and interaction among its members. By engaging in conversations and activities together, members of a religious group can foster strong connections and understanding, which in turn leads to effective communication. 3. Learn from each other: As members of a religious community, individuals often learn from one another through the sharing of teachings, experiences, and wisdom. This exchange of knowledge and understanding helps to strengthen their shared beliefs and practices, further solidifying the group's cohesion. 4. Participate in financial support for their religious institutions: Members of a religion often contribute financially to their religious institutions, supporting the maintenance of places of worship, organization of religious activities, and payment of religious leaders. This shared responsibility fosters a sense of belonging and commitment to the group and its beliefs. Although \\"believe in ghosts\\" may apply to some religious groups, it does not necessarily encompass all religions, nor is it a central aspect of religious identity, making it less relevant to the core commonalities among members of a religious community. In summary, members of a religion have a shared belief in a higher power or divine entity, engage in discussions and interactions as part of their religious community, learn from each other, and participate in financial support for their religious institutions. These commonalities serve as the basis for effective communication and a strong sense of group identity within the religious community."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Write an article with the title: \\"BBC Broadcasting House extension - review\\"","output":"Title: BBC Broadcasting House Extension - Review Step 1: Begin with an introductory paragraph about the BBC and the significance of the Broadcasting House extension The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has been a cornerstone of British culture since its establishment in 1922. As a public service broadcaster, it strives to inform, educate, and entertain a global audience. In line with its continuing growth and commitment to maintaining its status as a world-class media organization, the BBC has undertaken an extension project for its iconic Broadcasting House. This review will delve into the details of this ambitious and impressive project, assessing its impact on the organization, its staff, and the surrounding community. Step 2: Provide an overview of the Broadcasting House extension project The Broadcasting House extension, officially known as the W1 Programme, was initiated in 2003 with the goal of consolidating the majority of BBC’s offices and operations in a single, versatile and cutting-edge facility. The project involved the renovation of the original Broadcasting House, as well as the construction of a new extension building, known as the Peel Wing. Overall, the extension has added a staggering 80,000 square meters of space, allowing the BBC to optimize its functioning and respond more effectively to the demands of 21st-century broadcasting. Step 3: Discuss the architecture and design of the extension Designed by the renowned British architectural firm, MJP Architects, the Broadcasting House extension skillfully blends the old and the new. While the original Art Deco façade has been preserved, the new Peel Wing boasts a contemporary, sleek, and energy-efficient design. The glass and steel facade not only makes a visual impact but also cleverly symbolizes the transparency and openness the BBC is known for. The extension also includes a public piazza, further promoting community engagement and allowing visitors and staff alike to appreciate this architectural triumph. Step 4: Analyze the impact on operations and the working environment The consolidation of departments and teams into the extended Broadcasting House has resulted in improved collaboration and communication within the organization. Journalists, production teams, and support staff enjoy state-of-the-art facilities, which allow them to develop and deliver high-quality content more effectively. Moreover, the new environment has facilitated the sharing of ideas and information, fostering innovation and creativity. The numerous sustainable features of the building, such as green roofs and energy-efficient systems, demonstrate the BBC's commitment to reducing its environmental footprint and promoting sustainable practices. Step 5: Examine the public's reaction and the extension's impact on the local community The BBC Broadcasting House extension has been well-received by the public and critics alike. Its striking design and architectural ingenuity have garnered praise and positioned it as a landmark in London’s Fitzrovia district. The incorporation of public spaces and the creation of the piazza have revitalized the local community and increased its appeal as a must-visit destination for both tourists and Londoners alike. Additionally, the project has spurred economic growth in the area, as new businesses have opened to accommodate the influx of visitors and staff. Step 6: Conclude the review In conclusion, the BBC Broadcasting House extension stands as a testament to the enduring relevance and dynamism of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The project represents a successful marriage of heritage, architectural innovation, and a forward-looking approach to modern media operations. It serves not just as a hub for the production of world-class content, but also as a symbol of the BBC’s dedication to serving its audience and remaining a trusted source of news, entertainment, and education for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How much you look back and realize what you were given . Growing up , I was never given what I wanted . I got some of what I wanted from my parents . What may be the reason for not getting what you want ?","output":"There may be various reasons for not getting what you want in life, especially in the context described in the text. It is important to remember that multiple factors could contribute to this situation, depending on individual circumstances. Some of the possible reasons are: 1. Parental Priorities: The priorities of one's parents may have differed from their child's desires. In some cases, parents may value the importance of necessities like education, clothing, and shelter over materialistic or leisure-related wants. As a result, they might primarily focus on providing what they believe is essential for their child's future well-being. 2. Financial Constraints: Financial constraints or budget limitations might have played a significant role in not getting what one wants. Parents might have been unable to provide everything desired due to financial limitations at a particular point in time. Prioritizing expenses on more pressing needs, like healthcare or basic sustenance, could lead to some wants being unfulfilled. 3. Lessons in Impracticality: Parents might intentionally not provide everything their child wants to teach valuable life lessons, including understanding the difference between 'wants' and 'needs,' learning gratitude, and developing a strong sense of self-reliance. This approach aims to prepare children to face life's challenges and understand that they might not always get what they desire. 4. Developing Resilience: Life is full of obstacles and disappointments, and not always getting what one wants can help build resilience. By denying certain things, parents may hope to help their child cultivate adaptability and perseverance, enabling them to deal with unexpected situations and setbacks more effectively in the future. 5. Encouraging Appreciation: Refraining from fulfilling every want might encourage children to develop a sense of appreciation for what they have. By learning the value of what they already possess, children are more likely to be content in their lives, avoiding the pitfalls of perpetual dissatisfaction and materialism. 6. Instilling the Importance of Hard Work: Not always receiving what one desires might also serve as motivation to work harder for personal achievements. Parents may withhold certain wants as an incentive for their child to put in the effort and pursue opportunities on their own, fostering a strong work ethic and determination to succeed. 7. Societal Limits and Expectations: In some instances, societal norms and expectations may have played a role in not fulfilling all of a child's wants. For example, a parent might have been reluctant to allow their child to engage in certain behaviors or activities deemed socially unacceptable or not in line with traditional values. In conclusion, there may be numerous reasons for not getting what you want in life, particularly during childhood. These reasons often stem from parental decisions and circumstances, such as financial constraints, teaching valuable life lessons, or maintaining societal norms. Understanding and accepting these factors can help individuals reflect on their growth and form realistic expectations of life, leading to personal growth and a greater sense of satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: What will Carson want to do next? The answer is:","output":"Carson, after reading Jan's letter, experiences a rush of emotions, primarily anger and frustration. The content of the letter must have deeply affected Carson, triggering the need for an immediate conversation with Jan. Consequently, there are several steps that Carson will most likely want to take in order to address the situation: 1. Take a moment to calm down: Before approaching Jan, it's essential that Carson processes their immediate emotional reaction. This could involve taking deep breaths, going for a walk, or allowing some time to pass for the initial anger to subside. A calm and level-headed mindset would enable a more productive discussion and prevent impulsive decisions. 2. Reflect on the contents of the letter: Once Carson is calmer, they should re-read the letter to gain a thorough understanding of what exactly upset them. It's also important for Carson to consider Jan's point of view and ask themselves why Jan might have written those words. By understanding both perspectives, Carson can ensure a balanced and fair conversation. 3. Prepare for the conversation: Carson should write a list of points they want to address. This will help organize their thoughts and provide a clear structure for the conversation. Carson should be prepared to express how the letter made them feel, highlight specific areas of concern, and propose potential resolutions. 4. Arrange a meeting with Jan: Once the preparation is complete, Carson must decide on the most appropriate way to confront Jan. It could be through a face-to-face conversation, a phone call, or even a video call. Depending on the nature of their relationship, Carson ought to choose a mode of communication that feels most comfortable but also ensures an honest and open discussion. 5. Maintain a respectful and open-minded approach: During the conversation, Carson should remain respectful, listening actively to Jan's point of view, and avoiding blame or accusations. They should communicate their feelings and concerns assertively without resorting to aggressive language or dismissing Jan's perspective. Both parties should be open to finding common ground and working towards a resolution. 6. Reach a resolution or set a plan for moving forward: At the end of the conversation, Carson and Jan will ideally have either resolved their issue or developed a plan for moving forward. This could involve an apology, a commitment to better communication, or a follow-up conversation to check in on progress. 7. Reflect on the experience: Finally, Carson should take some time to reflect on the situation, assess whether the conversation was productive, and consider any personal growth or insights that may have emerged from the confrontation. This self-reflection can help Carson in future similar circumstances and contribute to the overall personal development. In conclusion, Carson's next step would be to calm down, carefully reflect on the contents of the letter and their feelings, and approach Jan with a well-structured conversation. By doing so, Carson can effectively address the situation, maintain a respectful and open-minded approach, and work towards a possible resolution of the conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Fall Out Boy is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001. The band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, lead guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which all members were involved at one point. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of the members' respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. By the time the break began, Stump was the heaviest he had ever been and loathed the band's image as an \\"emo\\" band. Coming home from tour, drummer Andy Hurley \\"went through the darkest depression [I've] ever felt. I looked at my calendar and it was just empty.\\" Wentz, who had been abusing Xanax and Klonopin, was divorced by his wife Ashlee Simpson and returned to therapy. \\"I'd basically gone from being the guy in Fall Out Boy to being the guy who, like, hangs out all day\\", Wentz recalled. Previously known as the \\"overexposed, despised\\" leader of the band, Wentz \\"simply grew up\\", sharing custody of his son and embracing maturity: \\"There was a jump-cut in my life. I started thinking - like, being old would be cool.\\"  During the hiatus, the band members each pursued individual musical interests, which were met with \\"varying degrees of failure\\". Stump was the only member of the quartet to take on a solo project while Fall Out Boy was on hiatus, recording debut album Soul Punk entirely on his own: he wrote, produced, and played every instrument for all tracks on the record. In addition, he married his longtime girlfriend and lost over sixty pounds through portion control and exercise. Stump blew through most of his savings putting together a large band to tour behind Soul Punk, but ticket sales were sparse and the album stalled commercially. During a particularly dark moment in February 2012, Stump poured his heart out in a 1500-word blog entry called \\"We Liked You Better Fat: Confessions of a Pariah\\". In the post, Stump lamented the harsh reception of the record and his status as a \\"has-been\\" at 27. Stump revealed that fans harassed him on his solo tour, hurling insults such as \\"We liked you better fat\\", and noted that \\"Whatever notoriety Fall Out Boy used to have prevents me from having the ability to start over from the bottom again.\\" Aside from Soul Punk and personal developments, Stump moonlighted as a professional songwriter/producer, co-writing tracks with Bruno Mars and All Time Low, and pursued acting.  Wentz formed electronic duo Black Cards with vocalist Bebe Rexha in July 2010. The project released one single before album delays led to Rexha's departure in 2011. Black Cards added Spencer Peterson to complete the Use Your Disillusion EP in 2012. Wentz also completed writing a novel, Gray, that he had been working on for six years outside the band, and began hosting the reality tattoo competition show Best Ink. Hurley ventured farther into rock during the hiatus, drumming with multiple bands over the three-year period. He continued to manage his record label, Fuck City, and drummed for bands Burning Empires and Enabler. He also formed heavy metal outfit The Damned Things with Trohman, Scott Ian and Rob Caggiano of Anthrax, and Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die. Despite this, the members all remained cordial to one another; Wentz was Stump's best man at his wedding. The hiatus was, all things considered, beneficial for the group and its members, according to Hurley. \\"The hiatus helped them all kind of figure themselves out\\", he explained in 2013. \\"Especially Joe and Patrick, who were so young. And Pete is a million times better.\\" Why did they take a hiatus?","output":"Fall Out Boy took a hiatus due to several reasons, largely stemming from personal struggles and a desire to explore individual interests. At the time, lead vocalist Patrick Stump was struggling with his weight and the band's emo image, while drummer Andy Hurley was battling severe depression. Bassist Pete Wentz, who had been abusing prescription medications, went through a divorce and returned to therapy.  During this hiatus, each band member pursued their own projects, albeit with varying degrees of success. Patrick Stump worked on a solo album, Soul Punk, and underwent significant personal transformation. Pete Wentz started an electronic duo project, Black Cards, and wrote a novel titled Gray. Andy Hurley explored different rock projects, managing his record label and drumming for several bands. Joe Trohman formed a new heavy metal band, The Damned Things, with Hurley and members of Anthrax and Every Time I Die. As stated by Hurley in 2013, \\"The hiatus helped them all kind of figure themselves out\\", explaining the break as ultimately beneficial for both the group and its members."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Goal: One seeks to make a movie costume for a baby. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"When we want to make a movie costume for a baby, we have two options: 1. Make a costume from scratch: This means we will create the costume ourselves using things like fabric, scissors, and sewing tools. We will pick a design from a movie and try to make it for the baby. 2. Buy a ready-made costume: This means we go to a store or online to buy a costume that is already made to look like a movie character. All we have to do is put it on the baby. To decide which method is more reasonable, we can think about a few things: - Time: If we don't have much time, it might be better to buy a ready-made costume, because making one from scratch can take a lot of time. - Skills: If we are good at sewing and making things, we can try making the costume from scratch. If not, buying a ready-made costume might be easier. - Personal preference: Some people enjoy making things, while others prefer buying them. Depending on what we like, we can choose one method or the other. - Budget: If we want to save money, we may be able to make the costume from scratch using materials we already have. On the other hand, some ready-made costumes can also be affordable. So, the best method really depends on what is most important to us and what we feel most comfortable doing. If we don't mind spending some money and want something quick, buying a costume might be more reasonable. But if we want to have fun making it and possibly save money, then making the costume from scratch could be the way to go."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I downloaded this app with high hopes, but it promptly failed to live up to my expectations. Here's a detailed breakdown of my 1-star rating: 1. User Interface: The interface is clunky and unattractive, making the app difficult to navigate. It seems like the design hasn't been updated in years, and it falls extremely short of the polished and modern look that I've come to expect from apps on my phone. 2. Performance: The app is sluggish and consistently crashes, even when performing the simplest of tasks. It's frustratingly slow and has rendered my email management borderline unmanageable. I've tried reinstalling and updating several times, but the problems persist. 3. Notifications: I've had countless instances in which the app has failed to notify me of important emails - some even time-sensitive. On the flip side, the app has also been sending me duplicate notifications for the same email, which is just as annoying. 4. Features: Although this app claims to have a wide range of features, I've found that many of them either don't work or are too difficult to set up due to the convoluted interface. The feature set is far from comprehensive, and I find it lacking in comparison to other email apps I've tried. 5.

In between  Xinji and Shanghai which one is located in the Yangtze River Delta? Answer:","output":"The city that is located in the Yangtze River Delta among the two - Xinji and Shanghai is Shanghai.  The Yangtze River Delta or YRD, also known as Yangzi Jiang Delta, is one of the most populous city-regions globally, located in the eastern part of China. It is centered around Shanghai and constitutes the surrounding provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang. So, it should be clarified that the provincial level municipality of Shanghai is an integral part of this delta. Shanghai, being one of the most crucial global financial hubs, abounds not only in population but also in significant economic implications. This city is also imbued with rich natural resources and complex networks of waterways. Its location in the Yangtze River Delta is a fundamental component facilitating these factors. On the other hand, Xinji is a county-level city of Hebei Province, China, which is administratively a part of the Hengshui city.

The question asks about the main activity of construction workers. 2. Construction workers are typically involved in the creation and maintenance of buildings and infrastructure. 3. The given options are:    a. make music - This is not relevant to the work of construction workers, as it involves creating and performing musical content.    b. build houses - This is very relevant to construction workers, as they are involved in constructing buildings.    c. talk to each other - While communication is essential for many professions, this is not the primary task of construction workers.    d. make gingerbread houses - This is associated with baking and festive activities, rather than construction work.    e. complete sentences - This is unrelated to the construction field and more focused on writing or editing tasks.

Context: Sondra Crench kicked a roach out of her way as she walked into her tiny apartment and sat down at her old laptop. It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games. Sounded pretty cool for kids. She wished there had been such a place when she was growing up there. But what really caught her eye was the note about auditions for a house band. It would play two hours a night, and earn 2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by. And besides, her band could do other gigs during the week to supplement it. Question: How old is Sondra?

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I climbed the ladder, heard my dive announced, and began the moves that would push me into the air. Pushing off the diving board with my legs, I lifted my arms and shoulders back, and knew immediately I would be close to the board and might hit my hands. I tried to correct myself as I turned, spreading my hands wide apart. Then I heard a strange sound and my body lost control. Moments later I realized I had hit my head on the board. At the beginning, I felt embarrassed. I wanted to hide, to get out of the pool without anyone seeing me. Next I felt intense fear. Had I cut my head? Was I bleeding? Was there blood in the pool? Swimming to the side, I noticed many shocked faces. People were worried about my head; I was worried about something far more threatening. An official examined my head. In a hurry, I pushed him away, and everyone else who approached me. \\"Don't touch me!\\" I felt like screaming. \\"Get away from me!\\" These were the trials   for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Korea. Until this dive, I had been ahead. But now, something else was more significant than winning. I might have endangered other divers' lives if I had spilled blood in the pool. For what I knew--- that few others knew - was that I was HIV-positive. According to my mother, my natural parents were Samoan   and only teenagers when I was born, so they gave me up for adoption. When I was only eighteen months old, I started gym classes. At ten, I explored doing gym exercises off the diving board at the pool. Because of my dark skin, kids at school called me names. My diving made me feel good about myself when my peers made me feel stupid. At sixteen, I knew I had a shot at the 1976 Olympics. Everyone was alarmed when I hit my head on the board in Seoul. Regardless, I made it to the finals. During my last dive in the finals, I enjoyed for the last time the quietness underwater and then swam to the side of the pool. The crowd cheered, and I knew I'd won --- two gold medals. AIDS forced me to stop diving; I had to give up diving professionally...

Joe unit, which is framed for stealing nuclear warheads from Pakistan by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce). The unit is subsequently decimated in a military air strike with Duke among the casualties. The only survivors are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). Meanwhile, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) rescue Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany, leaving Destro behind. Storm Shadow is injured during the escape and retreats to a temple in the Himalayas to recover. Upon learning that he is alive, the Blind Master (RZA), leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and his apprentice Jinx (Ãlodie Yung), Storm Shadow's cousin, to capture Storm Shadow so he can answer for the murder of his uncle, the Hard Master. Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye return to the United States where they set up a base of operations in a rundown gym. After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as America's elite special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the President will be attending. Lady Jaye steals a sample of the President's DNA and confirms that he is Zartan.

Q:As they left his house he insured them that it was okay they could come to the party too because it was taking place where? - friend's house - home - patio - fraternity house - boat  The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer is \\"fraternity house.\\" Based on the given information, it seems that the house where your friend met the others belongs to one of the group members, indicating a personal connection and suggesting that the party might be held at a location where they'd feel comfortable having their friends over. Among the provided options, a friend's house, home, and patio are quite informal and may not accommodate a larger number of guests. Meanwhile, a boat usually has limited space, and it might not be feasible to host a party for a larger group of friends there. A fraternity house, on the other hand, is a more suitable option for hosting a party. A fraternity house is typically associated with a college or university and serves as a residence for members of a social fraternity. These houses often have spacious interiors and can accommodate a larger number of guests, making them ideal for hosting events such as parties. It is also reasonable that a member of the fraternity would be comfortable inviting their friends to a party at the fraternity house, as it may be a place where social events regularly take place. Moreover, fraternity houses are often known for hosting lively parties, with a strong emphasis on community and building connections among members and their friends. As a result, it would be quite natural for a person to invite others to join a party at a fraternity house, making it the best answer among the given options. In conclusion, based on the fact that the group's acquaintance suggested it was okay for them to attend the party, and considering the suitability of the location to host a social event, it is most likely that the party is taking place at a fraternity house. Not only does this option provide ample space for guests, but it also reinforces the close connections found within the group and ensures that everyone has a good time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Which student feels he has moved from the second to the third echelon of students?  James Hart starts his first year at Harvard Law School in a very bad way. In his contract law course with Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr., he assumes the first class will be an outline of the course. When Kingsfield immediately delves into the material using the Socratic method and asks Hart the first question, Hart is totally unprepared and feels so utterly humiliated that, after class, he throws up in the bathroom. Hart is invited to join a study group with five other students:  Franklin Ford, the fifth generation of Fords at Harvard Law School Kevin Brooks, a married man with a photographic memory, but no analytical skills Thomas Anderson Willis Bell, an abrasive individual who is devoted to property law O'Connor (Robert Lydiard)While out getting pizza, Hart is asked by a woman, Susan Fields, to walk her home, due to her feeling uncomfortable with a man who had been following her. Hart returns to her house soon after and asks her on a date, after which they begin a relationship. Their relationship is complex; she resents the time he devotes to his studies, while he expects her to provide him with a great deal of attention and wants a firm commitment. When Hart and his classmates are invited to a cocktail party hosted by Kingsfield, he is stunned to discover that Susan is Kingsfield's married daughter. (She is, however, separated from her husband and eventually gets a divorce.) She and Hart break up and get back together several times. Hart divides the class into three groups: those who have given up; those who are trying, but fear being called upon in class to respond to Kingsfield's questions; and the \\"upper echelon\\".

The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters.

As a result, they become targets of contract killer Vincent (Michael Kelly) and must enter the Witness Protection Program. Paul and Meryl are relocated to the small town of Ray, Wyoming and placed temporarily under the protection of husband and wife/sheriff and deputy, Clay and Emma Wheeler (Sam Elliot and Mary Steenburgen).

They have trouble adjusting to small-town life, but after a perilous encounter with a bear and awkward attempts at shooting rifles, chopping wood, and horseback riding, they eventually adjust and begin assisting the local citizens professionally. Meanwhile, neither of their assistants back in New York know their whereabouts.

Input: CLOSE Brady Eaves, 18, the stepson of one-time Mississippi governor candidate John Arthur Eaves Jr, is show biting the head off a live hamster during spring break.      Brady Eaves, 18, of Madison, allegedly bit the head off a hamster in a spring break video.      Eaves (Photo: Screen grab)      The family of a Madison teen who is seen in a spring break video biting the head off a hamster has withdrawn him from enrollment at the University of Mississippi.      The teen in the grainy spring break video is Brady Eaves, 18, who was identified as a Phi Delta Theta from Ole Miss. On Tuesday, Phi Delt issued a statement that Eaves has been removed from the fraternity.      Eaves is the stepson of one-time Mississippi Governor candidate John Arthur Eaves Jr. John and Angel Eaves released a statement late Tuesday confirming they had withdrawn Brady from school in order to have his behavior professionally assessed.      In the video, Eaves is seen wearing a pink shirt with a wolf's face on it. He can be seen picking up the hamster, and then it appears he snaps its neck before biting its head off. He then appears to spit the head on the ground and throw the body as a crowd of people react with screams and cheers.      \\"Let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet,\\" the Eaves family's statement said.      On Tuesday, William Kneip, the president of the Mississippi Alpha Chapter of Phi Delta Theta, said the fraternity condemns Eaves' actions.      \\"We are very disappointed and disgusted in Brady's actions. These actions are inconsistent with what we believe as men of Phi Delta Theta and are inconsistent with the creed of the University of Mississippi,\\" Kneip said. \\"This incident was during spring break and is in no way associated with any chapter activity of Phi Delta Theta. Brady has been removed from the fraternity.\\"      Ole Miss' spring break was March 9-13. Kneip said the function was not a Phi Delt function, but he would not discuss how long the fraternity has been aware of the video or whether there were other Phi Delts there. He also would not discuss when Eaves was removed from the organization.      The video allegedly surfaced Friday night, when it was uploaded to YouTube with the title \\"psycho drunk spring breaker bites head off of hamster.\\" It was quickly removed for breaking YouTube's terms of service.      \\"As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son,\\" the Eaves' statement read. \\"We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again.\\"      The Eaves also said that the actions in the video do not reflect Brady Eaves' upbringing, and \\"his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character.\\"      The statement went on to ask for prayers for Brady Eaves and the family.      Officials confirmed that Eaves was a student at the University of Mississippi this semester.      \\"University officials were recently made aware of this spring break video and we are actively investigating,\\" said Dr. Brandi Hephner LaBanc, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. \\"While federal law prohibits us from discussing matters that involve individual students, university officials will take appropriate steps as soon as all the facts have been gathered.\\"      Sources close to Eaves told DailyMail.com that he is an \\"animal lover\\" whose numerous pets include a raccoon and a parrot.      The Daily Mail cited \\"sources connected to the incident\\" saying that the party of college students force-fed the hamster vodka and \\"hot-boxed\\" its cage with marijuana before it was orally decapitated.      PETA spokeswoman Stephanie Bell said someone sent that video to her organization over the weekend.      \\"Obviously we were horrified by the depictions in the video, and people are rightfully outraged about it,\\" she said. \\"Animal abuse is a community concern, and people who abuse animals rarely do so only once, and almost never stop there. The link between cruelty to animals and interpersonal violence is undeniable.\\"      Bell said PETA officials are working to verify exactly where the video was made.      \\"The Florida statute is actually quite strong. It prohibits causing cruel death or excessive or unnecessary pain or suffering, that would be considered aggravated animal cruelty, which is a felony in the third degree,\\" Bell said.      According to Florida case law, psychiatric or psychological counseling is also mandatory for convicted offenders of aggravated animal cruelty.      PETA is closely monitoring the situation, and will push for a vigorous prosecution and psychological counseling, Bell said.      \\"Animals feel pain stress and fear like we do and they are deserving of our respect and protection,\\" she said.      Felony animal cruelty charges in Florida carry a maximum jail term of five years and 5,000 in fines.

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Teacher:In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of numbers. Each list is presented with brackets and comma-separated values. For example, a list of numbers is [1,2,3] and a list of two lists of numbers is [[1,2],[3,4,6]]. You should sum up the values at every position of every inner list and put it as an element of your answer, that is, you should sum the first members of each inner list together and put it as the first element of the list, then sum the second members of each inner list together and put it as the second element of your list, etc. The output should be a list of numbers with the same length as the longest inner list. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: [[77, -95, -45, -89], [70, -23, 13, -4]] Student:","output":"Part  #1: Understanding the input structure. Usage: Here, the input is [[77, -95, -45, -89], [70, -23, 13, -4]]. In this example, it's a list containing two inner lists of numbers. The input structure is as follows - a list containing multiple lists, where each list contains numbers. The numbers can be either positive or negative. This meets the criteria because it follows the exact structure mentioned - a list of lists.  Part #2: Understanding the operation to perform. Usage: So, the operation here is to \\"sum up the values at each position\\". This means we need to take corresponding elements from each inner list and add them together. From the given input example, we take 77 from the first inner list and 70 from the second inner list, as they are at the same position (first) in both inner lists. Adding these together, we get 147 which becomes the first element of the output list. Part #3: The output list should have the same length as the longest inner list. Usage: The longest inner list in the input [[77, -95, -45, -89], [70, -23, 13, -4]] has 4 elements. So, our output list should also be of length 4. We add the corresponding elements of each list, following step #2, resulting in [147, -118, -32, -93]. This meets the criteria as the output is a list which has the same length as the longest inner list from the input. Part #4: The output should be a list of numbers. Usage: After performing the operations explained in step #2 on each position and on each inner list, we get the list [147, -118, -32, -93].

Question: Build a movie plot around this: What is the name of Jesse's teenage son? Hank. Answer:","output":"Title: The Secret Life of Hank Step 1: Establish the main characters and setting. My main characters will be Jesse, his teenage son Hank, and their family. The story will be set in a small, close-knit community, with most events taking place in their home, school, and other local spots. Step 2: Develop a central conflict or driving force for the plot. The central conflict will revolve around Hank discovering a shocking secret from Jesse's past that could change their family dynamic. Step 3: Introduce the main characters and set up the problem. In the beginning, we'll be introduced to Jesse, a hardworking and loving father, and Hank, a rebellious and misunderstood teenager. We'll see them struggling to connect as Hank enters high school and is increasingly distant from his father. Jesse tries to keep his family together, while Hank feels disconnected from everyone around him. Step 4: Explore Hank's teenage experiences and introduce the secret. As a subplot, we'll explore Hank's experiences as he tries to find his place among his peers and the perennial challenges of adolescence. Meanwhile, Hank stumbles upon a box of old letters and photos hidden in their attic, revealing that Jesse had another family before he met Hank's mother. The previous family had seemingly vanished, leaving no trace behind. Step 5: Increase tension and develop characters. The discovery of this secret fuels Hank's curiosity and estrangement from his father. Both characters are developed as they navigate this new conflict. Jesse becomes more secretive, trying to prevent the truth from coming out, while Hank becomes more determined to uncover the mystery behind his father's past. Step 6: Reach a turning point. The turning point occurs when Hank, with the help of his new high school friends, finds one of Jesse's long-lost family members and learns that Jesse was forced to leave his previous family to protect them from a dangerous past involving criminal activity. Step 7: Escalate the stakes. With this new information, Hank is torn between confronting his father or keeping the secret. As the truth spills out, Jesse's past enemies catch wind of his new life, putting Hank and his family in danger. Step 8: Climax and resolution. In the climax, Jesse and Hank must reconcile their differences and work together to protect their family and resolve past conflicts. With the help of their tight-knit community, they face Jesse's old enemies and expose the truth behind the mysterious disappearance of Jesse's first family. In the end, Jesse and Hank rebuild their relationship and forge a deeper bond, having learned the importance of honesty and understanding between a father and son. Step 9: Conclusion. The film concludes with Hank and Jesse finding closure and a newfound appreciation for each other. They continue to build and strengthen their relationship, while cherishing the bonds of family and community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hypothesis: the girls are fifteen .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"In analyzing the premise and the hypothesis, we must closely examine the information provided and assess the logical connections between them. Premise: Two girls are playing instruments in a group. The premise informs us that there are two girls who are part of a group and that they play instruments. This statement provides a basic description of the girls' involvement in the group and their role as musicians. However, it does not provide any explicit information related to their age. Hypothesis: The girls are fifteen. The hypothesis proposes that the girls are fifteen years old. This statement attempts to make a connection between the ages of the girls and their participation in the group.  Now, let's evaluate whether we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true.  Since the premise only describes the girls' roles as musicians in a group, there is no direct or indirect information provided regarding their ages. The premise and hypothesis are two distinct statements, with the former focusing on the girls' activities and the latter on their ages. Consequently, the truth of the premise cannot automatically validate the hypothesis, which means that we cannot conclude that the girls are fifteen based only on the premise. In conclusion, while the premise is true and provides valuable context about the girls' involvement in a music group, it does not contain sufficient information to confirm or refute the hypothesis. To determine the accuracy of the hypothesis, additional information, such as the girls' birthdates or explicit age references, would be necessary. As it stands, there is no valid basis for concluding that the girls are fifteen based solely on the provided premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - get out what i am going to eat with. - get food - eat food - stop working - find food  Explain why a human would choose \\"eat food\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"eat food\\" as the correct answer to the question \\"What do you do when you have lunch?\\" because the primary purpose of having lunch is to consume and enjoy food. While the other options listed might be steps involved in the overall process of having lunch, \\"eat food\\" is the central action. Here's a brief explanation for each option: - Get out what I am going to eat with: This step involves preparing utensils, plates, or other items needed to eat lunch. It is a prerequisite step in the process, but not the main action. - Get food: This step could refer to collecting or purchasing food that will be eaten for lunch. Again, this is an important part of the process but not the primary objective of having lunch. - Eat food: This is the correct answer because it represents the core purpose of having lunch. Eating food is essential as it provides the human body with nutrients and energy necessary for functioning. - Stop working: While it's true that many people often take a break from work during lunchtime, this is not the main action of having lunch. Stopping work might accompany having lunch, but it is not the sole purpose. - Find food: Similar to \\"get food,\\" this step refers to the process of locating or choosing food to eat, rather than the actual act of consuming it. In conclusion, \\"eat food\\" is the appropriate answer to the question, as it directly represents the main goal of having lunch - consuming food to satiate hunger and provide energy to the body."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Which board game has a maximum score of 307: Twin Tin Bots or Take It Easy? A:","output":"After researching and analyzing the scoring mechanisms for both Twin Tin Bots and Take It Easy, I can provide you with a detailed and long answer. Twin Tin Bots is a strategic board game where players program robots to collect and deliver crystals while avoiding various obstacles. Each player has these mini-bots at their disposal to gather resources and bring them back to their base. The scoring mechanism of this game is centered around collecting the highest value crystals represented by different shapes or colors. The scoring criteria of Twin Tin Bots depend on the value of the crystals that bots collect. There's no specific maximum score with a clearly defined numeric value mentioned for this game. The winner is determined by whoever collects the most valuable crystals by the end of the game. Take It Easy, on the other hand, is a tile-placement board game where players arrange hexagonal tiles onto their own game boards. Each tile consists of three colored lines, which converge at its center. The game objective is to align the same-colored lines to connect adjacent edges of the game board. When this is achieved, players gain points, and the scores are based on the number shown on each line multiplied by the length of the connected line. The maximum score in Take It Easy is achieved when a player can align all three colors in the most optimal way across the board. Through optimal placement, players can achieve a maximum score of 307 points, which is the highest score in standard Take It Easy. In conclusion, the board game with a maximum score of 307 points is Take It Easy. The game's scoring structure relies on the tiles' value and their strategic placement to create continuous lines. Twin Tin Bots is about acquiring valuable crystals, and though a winner is determined by the end of the game, no numeric maximum score is specified."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: If John isn't acquitted, it will only make Mary happier. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The first sentence implies that Mary's happiness depends on John being acquitted, which suggests that she cares for him or his situation. This sentence shows concern for Mary's well-being and assumes that her happiness is closely tied to the outcome of John's acquittal. In this context, Mary's happiness would be significantly affected if John were not acquitted, and the speaker hopes that the situation remains in favor of John. The second sentence, however, contradicts the first sentence. It states that Mary would be happier if John is not acquitted, suggesting that Mary's happiness would increase with a negative outcome for John. This sentence implies that Mary may have reasons to desire an unfavorable result for John, such as resentment, revenge, or personal gain. Since the two sentences are in direct contradiction with each other, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence would be false.

They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan,  Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to  Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source,  Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack,  Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to  Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad.

The sixty-one year reign of the Kangxi Emperor was the longest of any Chinese emperor. Kangxi's reign is also celebrated as the beginning of an era known as the \\"High Qing\\", during which the dynasty reached the zenith of its social, economic and military power. Kangxi's long reign started when he was eight years old upon the untimely demise of his father. To prevent a repeat of Dorgon's dictatorial monopolizing of power during the regency, the Shunzhi Emperor, on his deathbed, hastily appointed four senior cabinet ministers to govern on behalf of his young son. The four ministers — Sonin, Ebilun, Suksaha, and Oboi — were chosen for their long service, but also to counteract each other's influences. Most important, the four were not closely related to the imperial family and laid no claim to the throne. However, as time passed, through chance and machination, Oboi, the most junior of the four, achieved such political dominance as to be a potential threat. Even though Oboi's loyalty was never an issue, his personal arrogance and political conservatism led him into an escalating conflict with the young emperor. In 1669 Kangxi, through trickery, disarmed and imprisoned Oboi — a significant victory for a fifteen-year-old emperor over a wily politician and experienced commander. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who ruled while Kangxi was young?","output":"While Kangxi was young, the governance of the Qing dynasty was in the hands of four senior cabinet ministers - Sonin, Ebilun, Suksaha, and Oboi - who were appointed by Kangxi's father, the Shunzhi Emperor, on his deathbed. These ministers were intended to support and guide the young emperor, counteract each other's influences, and prevent the monopolization of power that had occurred during previous regencies. Kangxi eventually managed to remove the most dominant among them, Oboi, and asserted his control over the government when he was fifteen years old. Thus, during Kangxi's youth, the four ministers effectively ruled the empire in a regency until the emperor was able to consolidate power and govern directly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Familiarize yourself with common clues that indicate a potential carpet beetle problem and make yourself aware of how carpet beetles look.  Fecal pellets and shed skins are the most common signs of infestation. Available options:  1). You can also expect to see carpet beetles in both adult and larvae forms.

Title: Exceptional Dining Experience at The River's Edge Last Saturday, my friends and I decided to try out The River's Edge, a restaurant we've heard nothing but rave reviews about. Our expectations were high; however, the incredible experience we had surpassed everything we could have imagined. We had reservations for 7 pm, and upon arriving, we found the restaurant to be nestled in a picturesque setting alongside a serene river. The outdoor patio allowed a breathtaking view of the waterfront. The atmosphere was warm, inviting, and elegant, with dimly lit candles, beautiful table settings, and soft music playing in the background. It was the perfect balance of sophistication and comfort. We were seated right away by the friendly host, who offered us a delightful view of the river. Our server, Sarah, was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and attentive throughout our entire dining experience. She suggested some fabulous appetizers to start, and we were delighted with her recommendations. The spinach and artichoke dip with warm pita bread was creamy and delectable, and the crispy calamari was seasoned to perfection. For the main course, I opted for the pan-seared salmon with roasted garlic potatoes, while my friends ordered the filet mignon and the parmesan-crusted chicken. Each dish was cooked perfectly and had a beautiful presentation. The flavors were bold and innovative, and the portion sizes were generous without being overwhelming. To complete our meal, Sarah suggested we indulge in the chef's signature dessert: vanilla bean crème brûlée. This was, without a doubt, the best crème brûlée I have ever tasted – the caramelized sugar on top had a wonderful crunch, and the custard was velvety smooth. Throughout the evening, the service was consistent and attentive without being intrusive. Sarah regularly checked on us, and the restaurant's management even stopped by our table to ensure that everything was to our satisfaction. We were impressed by this level of attention and care towards the patrons. The River's Edge not only delivered a mouthwatering meal but also offered an evening filled with wonderful ambiance, exceptional service, and an unparalleled view. Our expectations were truly exceeded, and I know we will be returning in the near future. I would highly recommend The River's Edge to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or indulge in an unforgettable dining experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Eden Foods has become the new front line in the contest over religion, health care and the workplace. Eden Foods is a closely held, for-profit corporation that objects to covering contraception on religious grounds. It lost its lawsuit last October, but the ruling was stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision on Hobby Lobby. Now, Eden Foods has a clear legal pathway to deny contraception coverage to its employees. Eden Foods, however, is in a very different business than Hobby Lobby. It sells organic products, a market that relies on educated, well-informed, urban consumers, a demographic that trends liberal. In response to the renewed attention on the Eden Foods case, defenders of the company, people who want to buy their products with a clean conscience, and the organic food stores who want to stay out of the crossfire, are all arguing that this is just a political dispute. Moreover, I base my conclusion that the issue at hand is ethical, and not political, on the statements coming from OPTIONS: - CNN itself. - David Perry itself. - Eden Foods itself. - Hobby Lobby itself. - Perry itself. - Supreme Court itself. - Whole Foods itself.","output":"Eden Foods itself. The other options are incorrect because they are not the subject of the sentence or the topic discussed. CNN is the news network reporting the story, but it is not the source of the statements.

Answer the question Near Earth's equator, water generally exists naturally in the liquid and gas states. In which other part of Earth is water usually found naturally in only two states? Select from: (a). Indian Ocean; (b). interior of Africa; (c). South Pole; (d). Tropic of Cancer;","output":"The correct answer to this question is (c). South Pole. At the South Pole, water is generally found naturally in only two states: solid and gas. The South Pole is located at Earth's southernmost point, on the continent of Antarctica. Antarctica is a frozen continent, with its ice sheet containing nearly 90% of Earth's freshwater reserves. Due to the extreme cold, water exists primarily in the solid state, as ice, and in the gas state, as water vapor. To further clarify this point, let's examine why the other options are not correct: (a) Indian Ocean: The Indian Ocean is a vast body of water, and as with any ocean, it predominantly features water in its liquid state. Here, water can be found in all three states: solid (in the form of icebergs and frozen regions near Antarctica), liquid (the majority of the ocean), and gas (water vapor evaporating from the ocean). (b) Interior of Africa: The interior of Africa spans a wide range of climates, from the arid Sahara Desert to lush, green savannas and rainforests. In these diverse environments, water is typically found in all three states: solid (in high-altitude regions like mountain ranges), liquid (e.g., lakes, rivers, and groundwater), and gas (humidity and evaporation). (d) Tropic of Cancer: The Tropic of Cancer is the northernmost latitude where the sun can be directly overhead at its zenith. This line runs through various continents, each with distinct climate zones and water availability. As such, water is usually found naturally in all three states in different regions along the Tropic of Cancer: solid (in high-altitude regions like the Himalayas), liquid (lakes, rivers, oceans), and gas (water vapor and humidity). In summary, the South Pole (Antarctica) is the place where water is typically found naturally in only two states, solid and gas, due to its extremely cold and inhospitable environment. In contrast, options A, B, and D involve a wider range of climate zones and geographic locations, where water can be found in all three states: solid, liquid, and gas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Sasha's decision to represent herself in court may have been influenced by several factors. It's essential to understand that when someone chooses to represent themselves in legal proceedings, they essentially act as their own attorney. This scenario is often referred to as \\"pro se\\" representation, which is a Latin term meaning \\"on one's own behalf.\\" Below are some reasons why Sasha may have chosen to take this route: 1. Financial constraints: Hiring a lawyer can be expensive, and not everyone is in a position to afford one. Legal fees can add up quickly and become a significant burden, especially if the case drags on for an extended period. Sasha may have opted to represent herself to save money. 2. Confidence in her own capabilities: It's possible that Sasha felt confident in her ability to represent herself effectively. Her background, education, or prior experiences may have given her the necessary skills to navigate the legal system without the assistance of a lawyer. 3. Belief in the simplicity of the case: Sasha might have thought that her case was simple enough to handle without professional legal assistance. If the case involved a straightforward issue or demanded a simple resolution, she may have believed that she could handle it on her own. 4. Desire for control: By representing herself in court, Sasha maintained full control over her case. She may have had previous negative experiences working with attorneys or gained a distrust of the legal profession in general. This could have prompted her decision to handle the case independently, allowing her to make all necessary decisions and control her narrative entirely. 5. A lack of trust in available legal representation: Sasha may not have been able to find a lawyer she felt comfortable working with or trusted to handle her case effectively. This situation could arise if she had limited options for local attorneys or encountered challenges in selecting an attorney within her budget. 6. Limited access to adequate legal representation: In some cases, individuals might struggle to secure appropriate legal counsel due to factors such as workload constraints or a shortage of qualified lawyers in their area. This could have led Sasha to decide that representing herself was the best option. It's important to remember that representing oneself in court can be a very challenging and complex process. While some individuals may have valid reasons for choosing to do so, it's generally recommended to seek professional legal counsel when engaging with the legal system. This is because legal proceedings often involve intricate rules of evidence and procedure that can be difficult to navigate without proper training and experience. Moreover, having a lawyer can significantly impact the outcome of a case by ensuring that a defendant's rights are fully protected throughout the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the person who ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region?  In 1684, a council led by Enrique Enríquez de Guzmán, the governor of Guatemala, decided on the reduction of San Mateo Ixtatán and nearby Santa Eulalia, both within the colonial administrative district of the Corregimiento of Huehuetenango.On 29 January 1686, Captain Melchor Rodríguez Mazariegos, acting under orders from the governor, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán, where he recruited indigenous warriors from the nearby villages, 61 from San Mateo itself. It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtatán were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts of what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas and the western part of the Petén Basin. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Cristóbal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtatán on 3 February, where Captain Rodríguez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepción also remained in the town. Governor Enriquez de Guzmán subsequently left San Mateo Ixtatán for Comitán in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.In 1695, a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán.

Some sticky substances, like hot glue or gum, become very brittle when they are frozen. Put the fabric in the freezer until the sticky substance is completely frozen. This method works better with gum and glue-like substances rather than stickers or sticky substances that have seeped into the fabric.

To make the mixtures, he has to dissolve nitrogen gas in containers of water. In one container, container A, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under high pressure. In the other container, container B, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under low pressure.  Which container will have lower solubility of the nitrogen gas?","output":"To determine which container will have lower solubility of the nitrogen gas, we need to consider the effect of pressure on gas solubility in a liquid. This can be explained using Henry's Law, which states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid. This means that the higher the pressure applied, the more gas will dissolve in the liquid. Step 1: Look at the pressure conditions for both containers. Container A: High pressure Container B: Low pressure Step 2: Apply Henry's Law to determine solubility under each condition. - Under high pressure (Container A), the solubility of the nitrogen gas will be higher, as a greater amount of gas will dissolve in the liquid. - Under low pressure (Container B), the solubility of the nitrogen gas will be lower, as a lesser amount of gas will dissolve in the liquid. Conclusion: Based on Henry's Law and the pressure conditions, container B will have a lower solubility of nitrogen gas compared to container A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choices:  A). negative;  B). positive;Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness","output":"The phrase \\"of scene-chewing, teeth-gnashing actorliness\\" can be considered negative in its connotation.  First of all, let's deconstruct the phrase to understand its meaning better.  1. Scene-chewing: This term is an informal way to describe actors who engage in an exaggerated, over-the-top style of acting. These actors tend to play their roles with high energy and excessive emoting, often drawing too much attention to themselves and away from the narrative or other characters. Overacting, or \\"chewing the scenery,\\" can be off-putting and disruptive in the context of a film, play, or television show, consequently leading to a negative interpretation of the phrase. 2. Teeth-gnashing: Gnashing one's teeth usually implies aggressiveness, frustration, anger, or annoyance. The term is often used figuratively to express intense negative emotions. When applied to an actor's performance, it suggests that their portrayal of a character is filled with extreme emotions, possibly to the point of being grating or tiresome for the audience. 3. Actorliness: This term refers to the quality of being an actor or the propensity to act in a theatrical manner. In the context of the given phrase, it seems to accentuate the excessiveness of the acting style mentioned earlier, adding to the negative connotation. In summary, the phrase \\"of scene-chewing, teeth-gnashing actorliness\\" describes a theatrical, over-the-top, and excessively emotional acting style that detracts from the overall quality of a performance. This description carries a negative connotation, as it implies that the actor's approach is not adequately aligned with the intentions of the material being performed. The exaggerated expressions and emotions may overshadow other elements of the performance, yielding an undesirable and disruptive effect on the audience's experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Have you ever been in a situation, where you felt uneasy because of something you think you may have forgotten to do or perhaps a feeling that you annoyed someone whom you wanted to get along with really well. If you have experienced such feelings and worse on a regular basis, then you most probably are a victim of anxiety attacks. All of us, to some extent, have experienced anxiety at different levels. There are somethings you may know about anxiety, and some things that you may not be familiar with. So in order to be prepared for your unexpected feeling of anxiety, you need to get to know what anxiety is before it _ into a panic attack. Anxiety is simply the feeling of discomfort, uneasiness or fear of what may eventually happen resulting from an imagined, or a real threatening condition. On the extreme end panic attacks can occur due to heightened  feelings of anxiety. There are two main symptoms  during an anxiety / panic attack and these are physical and emotional symptoms. Physical symptoms include difficulty in breathing, shaking, direct feeling of heat, rapid heartbeat and tiredness while emotional symptoms deal with worrying, depression, fear, and lack of focus. In spite of the negative impression we have for anxiety, it is not dangerous in any way whatever. The feeling of anxiety is not bad, in fact it's more of a defensive feeling which protects us from possible danger by engaging a response within us in fight or fight situations. So it's not the \\"bad guy\\", you just have to learn how to control it. Panic attacks, however, are far more dangerous and should be a concern to your health. Panic can sometimes result in blurred   vision, difficulty in breathing due to a tight chest. The best way to different anxiety from any serious illness is to ask a medical expert for advice on a regular basis.

Is \\"This means that the number of defects in a software product can be very large and defects that occur infrequently are difficult to find in testing.\\" the correct answer?","output":"While the statement \\"This means that the number of defects in a software product can be very large and defects that occur infrequently are difficult to find in testing.\\" is indeed related to some of the issues that can cause software to underperform, there are numerous other non-functional dimensions to consider. Non-functional dimensions refer to attributes that affect the performance and quality of software but do not impact its primary functional requirements. Here is a detailed and long answer that explores various non-functional dimensions that can cause software to underperform and cause other problems: 1. Scalability: If a software system is not able to handle an increased workload or number of users, it may underperform. Scalability issues can arise from ineffective resource management and communication overhead. 2. Reliability: A software system's reliability is its capacity to consistently operate correctly over an extended period. A system that experiences frequent crashes or errors can cause significant disruptions and hinder user satisfaction. 3. Performance: This relates to a software system's ability to process tasks or requests expediently. Performance issues can arise due to poor algorithm efficiency, inadequate hardware, or insufficient resources. 4. Maintainability: Code maintainability denotes the ease with which a software system can be modified, updated, or enhanced. Poorly maintainable code can lead to increased costs, technical debt, and potential errors during updates or modifications. 5. Testability: Software testability is the degree to which a system can be tested effectively and efficiently. It's crucial to identify defects early in the development lifecycle. Poor testability can result in the discovery of defects later in the process, leading to increased costs and delays. 6. Usability: A system's usability evaluates how easy and intuitive it is for the user to interact with it. Poor usability can hinder user adoption, lower productivity, and lead to errors. 7. Security: Security addresses the protection of software systems against unauthorized access and nefarious activity. Neglecting security can lead to data breaches, compromised systems, and a loss of user trust. 8. Portability: Software portability refers to the ability of a system to function effectively across different platforms and environments. Lack of portability can make it difficult to transition a software system between platforms, hindering its adaptation and limiting its potential user base. 9. Compatibility: Compatibility is the ability of a software system to work seamlessly with other systems, devices, or components. Incompatibilities can result in conflicts, resource consumption problems, and degradation of system functionality. 10. Resilience: A resilient software system can recover quickly from failures or disruptions without losing data or encountering significant downtime. Insufficient resilience can negatively impact stakeholder trust and lead to higher operational costs. In conclusion, numerous non-functional dimensions can cause software to underperform and cause other problems. While the presence of defects, as mentioned in the original statement, is a valid concern, it is essential to evaluate these other aspects when assessing software performance and the potential issues that may arise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the last couple of years the selfie has seen a meteoric rise to fame and was even given the Royal Seal of approval during the Commonwealth Games when some opportunistic youngsters managed to take one with her Majesty in the background. But now there is a new way to document your day – the dronie, where all of your photos are taken by a drone. French drone manufacturer Parrot say the increasingly popular method of using a remote controlled miniature aircraft is down to 'narcissism' - as people are buying them ready fitted with cameras in order to film themselves. Forget selfies - people are now using drones to take photos and videos, like this couple in Portugal. Up to 30,000 of the remote-controlled devices are predicted to have been sold by the end of this year. Drones are also increasingly being used at weddings, giving the bride and groom high-quality footage of their big day from an aerial perspective. Henri Seydoux, Parrot’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that the drones of the future will be able to pilot themselves, automatically following their subject around. He told the paper: ‘It would be like having a full TV crew with you when you went snowboarding or mountain climbing.’ He said that sales of drones jumped by 130 per cent in the third quarter of the year, taking the company by surprise. A woman gets her photo taken by a remote controlled flying dronie in a snow covered New Zealand. A group of brave adventurers had this picture taken by a dronie in Costa Rica as they crossed a rope bridge. Mr Seydoux added: ‘It turned out that in reality people bought the drones because of narcissism. ‘People want to put pictures on YouTube of them looking strong and talented, and that is why people want the cameras.’ However, last month it was revealed a passenger plane had a near miss with a drone as it landed at Heathrow, in the first such incident recorded at Britain’s biggest airport. The incident involved an Airbus A320, which can carry up to 180 passengers, and was rated by investigators as among the most serious near-collisions. The aircraft was at just 700ft at 2.16pm on July 22 when the pilot saw the drone, which had not shown up on air traffic control radar. He reported the sighting and an inquiry was launched by the UK Airprox Board, which investigates all reported near-misses. Investigators, however, were unable to identify it. It comes amid concern over the threat to aircraft from domestic drones flown by amateurs - especially as they are expected to be a must have Christmas present this year. Drones cost from as little as £35 - and sales have jumped thanks to extra demand. It is estimated that more than 30,000 drones will have been bought by British consumers by the end of the year — a high proportion of them as Christmas presents. The electronics chain Maplin says that sales within its stores are up 300 per cent on 2013. Last month, a conference on unmanned aerial systems in London heard that police were worried about injuries and other problems on Boxing Day when amateur ‘pilots’ try out their new drones. This group of friends and their dogs shot a video on a dronie of their walk up Bernal Hill in San Francisco. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Opponents say that the expansion will make air quality and noise pollution much worse. It makes a complete mockery of the government's commitments on cutting carbon emissions, they say. But supporters of the airport say that developments in technology will mitigate many negative consequences. Third runway at Heathrow cleared for takeoff What happens next? Why expansion is taking so long Is new runway more important post-Brexit? The green price of Heathrow expansion Death sentence for Heathrow villages In its final report on Heathrow last year, the Airports Commission was clear that an extra runway at the UK's biggest flight centre would be an opportunity to right some of the environmental wrongs that have developed through ad hoc expansion over the years. These include increased levels of noise for local residents, consistent breaches of air pollution safety levels and increasing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Perhaps the easiest of these issues to tackle is noise. The Airports Commission suggested that a \\"noise envelope\\" should be agreed and Heathrow would be legally bound to stay within these limits. There should also be an increased noise levy to benefit local communities  - and an independent aviation noise committee should be established with a statutory right to be consulted on operating procedures. In their statement announcing the airport's expansion, the government gave some clear indications of how it will tackle this question. It will propose a six-and-a-half hour ban on scheduled night flights for the first time. It will also propose new legally binding noise targets that will encourage the use of quieter planes - and there will be a pot of cash, some Â£700m, to pay for noise insulation for local residents. On the other two key environmental impacts the government is on far trickier ground. When it comes to dirty air, the UK has been breaching EU limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) since 2010 in a number of different regions and cities. This pollutant is produced from diesel engines and is linked to a range of respiratory illnesses. Heathrow has long been a hot spot for this type of air pollution due to heavy traffic in the vicinity - so much so that the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) projected that even without expansion, the A4 running north of the airport would still exceed EU safety limits for nitrogen dioxide in 2030. The airport points to recent independent research that says the expansion would only lead to a \\"marginal\\" increase in NO2 from Heathrow as there would be significant reductions elsewhere thanks to changes in diesel engines and greater use of electric vehicles. Campaigners are not impressed with this conclusion. \\"The measures that people have put forward seem fairly far fetched in terms of implementation,\\" said Tim Johnson, from the Aviation Environment Federation. \\"Ideas like taking diesel cars off the road are indeed potential solutions, but how do you get consumer change that makes that happen in the time scale?\\" Perhaps the biggest environmental challenge of the expansion is the impact on climate change goals. Existing UK legislation commits the government to cut CO2 levels by 80% of 1990 levels in 2050. Aviation right now accounts for around 6% of UK emissions. To meet the legal target, emissions from this sector would would have to stay below the 2005 mark. This could be partly achieved with improvements in fuel and aircraft operational efficiency and the wider use of biofuels, says the independent Committee on Climate Change (CCC). They are calling on the government to publish a strategic policy framework for UK aviation emissions to limit them to 2005 levels. To keep below the target, the CCC says that \\"this could imply limiting the growth in demand to around 60% above 2005 levels by 2050 (45% above current levels).\\" That could mean the government having to cut airport capacity in regional airports or have other sectors of the economy make deeper emissions cuts. \\"You only have so much carbon to go round,\\" said Tim Johnson. \\"The government will have to decide how best to distribute that, if they decide to use that for a new runway then there will have to be a hit elsewhere.\\" But speaking in the House of Commons, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling refuted the suggestion that the expansion of Heathrow was bad for the climate. \\"We take the issue of climate change very seriously and this government has a whole raft of measures in place to address the issue, but we also have to make sure that we have the prosperity in this country to do things like funding our NHS and funding our old age pensions, and having a thriving modern economy with strong links around the world is an important part of that.\\" Other campaigning groups believe the lack of a clear plan on how to mitigate increases in CO2 make the third runway a very bad idea. \\"With the government poised to sign the Paris climate agreement, it's decision to expand Heathrow - shortly after forcing fracking on the people of Lancashire - looks deeply cynical,\\" said Andrew Pendleton, from Friends of the Earth. \\"However this is only the first step on a long journey that will see communities, councils and climate campaigners continue the battle to reverse this misjudged and damaging decision.\\" One area in which there is a little dispute over the benefits of Heathrow's expansion is in regard to wildlife. The airport has committed to a Â£105m plan to transform a green area near the airport, into a haven four times the size of Hyde Park. Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the environmental implications of expanding Heathrow with a third runway. Critics argue that the expansion will exacerbate air and noise pollution, contradicting the government's carbon emission reduction commitments. However, supporters assert that technological advancements will counterbalance these negative impacts. The Airports Commission’s report details how the expansion could address existing environmental issues at Heathrow, such as increased noise exposure, consistent air pollution safety level breaches, and rising CO2 emissions. A suggested solution is a \\"noise envelope\\", legally binding limits within which Heathrow must operate. Additionally, they recommend higher noise levies to benefit local communities and the use of quieter planes. On the topic of air pollution, the UK has been surpassing EU nitrogen dioxide (NO2) limits since 2010. This pollutant, a byproduct of diesel engines, is linked to respiratory illnesses. Despite research suggesting the expansion will only marginally increase NO2 levels due to engine alterations and increased electric vehicle use, campaigners remain skeptical. The most significant environmental challenge posed by the expansion, according to the article, is the conflict with climate change goals. Current UK law mandates an 80% reduction on CO2 emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. Aviation currently contributes around 6% to these emissions. To meet the target, measures such as fuel improvements, increased operational efficiency, and a shift towards biofuels are needed, according to the independent Committee on Climate Change. While there's concern that pursuing the expansion could rob other sectors of needed carbon allowances, there is a lack of controversy regarding the potential benefits for local wildlife, as the airport has promised a £105m plan to convert a green area near it into a sanctuary four times the size of Hyde Park."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected.

You are given a new situation: Dan decided to preserve some fruit and roots to see how long they last before they spoil. He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango.  and a hint : Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  Please answer this question : Which fruit have a lower sugar content candied plums or fresh oranges? A:","output":"Fresh oranges have a lower sugar content compared to candied plums.  Candying fruits involves soaking them in sugar syrup for an extended period, which causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar. This process significantly increases the sugar content of the fruit compared to their fresh counterparts. Candied plums, being subjected to this process, will have a much higher sugar content than they naturally possess. On the other hand, fresh oranges have not undergone any preservation or sugar infusion process, so their sugar content remains the same as it is naturally occurring in the fruit. As a result, fresh oranges contain less sugar than candied plums."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

In a letter to BP, Markey, D-Massachusetts, said scientific evidence showed such plumes have formed and he asked for BP CEO Tony Hayward to provide evidence to back up Hayward's claim Sunday that the spilled oil had gone to the surface. On Sunday, Markey, who heads the House Energy and Environment subcommittee, had accused BP of issuing false statements about the oil spill. \\"BP in this instance means 'Blind to Plumes,'\\" Markey said in a statement Monday. There was no immediate response from BP. Markey's letter to BP said \\"the confirmation of the presence of large quantities of oil sub-surface could help to inform clean-up and response efforts, and it is vital that there is unfettered access to all relevant data or analysis.\\" The letter noted that University of South Florida researchers recently reported finding a 22-mile-long plume of dispersed oil. In a separate letter Monday to BP, Markey called for complete transparency regarding video feeds of the company's underwater operations. BP is launching a new effort to cut an opening to the leaking equipment so that a containment dome can be lowered on it. \\"There cannot be any delay or gaps in our understanding of this situation, given that thousands of barrels of oil are spewing forth each day into the Gulf, with catastrophic long-term consequences,\\" said Markey's letter to BP America head Lamar McKay, later adding: \\"BP should not be controlling the view the American public has of this disaster in our ocean.\\"","output":"A man named Edward Markey said that a big company called BP was wrong about no underwater oil plumes in the ocean because of a big oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico.

Philip Chapman Lesh (born March 15, 1940) is a musician and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, with whom he played bass guitar throughout their 30-year career. After the band's disbanding in 1995, Lesh continued the tradition of Grateful Dead family music with side project Phil Lesh and Friends, which paid homage to the Dead's music by playing their originals, common covers, and the songs of the members of his band. Lesh operates a music venue called Terrapin Crossroads. He scaled back his touring regimen in 2014 but continues to perform with Phil Lesh & Friends at select venues. Lesh was an innovator in the new role that the electric bass developed during the mid-1960s. Contemporaries such as Casady, Bruce, James Jamerson and Paul McCartney adopted a more melodic, contrapuntal approach to the instrument; before this, bass players in rock had generally played a conventional timekeeping role within the beat of the song, and within (or underpinning) the song's harmonic or chord structure. While not abandoning these aspects, Lesh took his own improvised excursions during a song or instrumental. This was a characteristic aspect of the so-called San Francisco Sound in the new rock music. In many Dead jams, Lesh's bass is, in essence, as much a lead instrument as Garcia's guitar.  Lesh was not a prolific composer or singer with the Grateful Dead, although some of the songs he did contribute--\\"New Potato Caboose\\", \\"Box of Rain\\", \\"Unbroken Chain\\", and \\"Pride of Cucamonga\\"--are among the best-known in the band's repertoire. Lesh's high tenor voice contributed to the Grateful Dead's three-part harmony sections in their group vocals in the early days of the band, until he largely relinquished singing high parts to Donna Godchaux (and thence Brent Mydland and Vince Welnick) in 1976 due to vocal cord damage from improper singing technique. In 1985, he resumed singing lead vocals on select songs as a baritone. Throughout the Grateful Dead's career, his interest in avant-garde music remained a crucial influence on the group.  In 1994, he was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: did he win any awards for his music","output":"Yes, in 1994, Phil Lesh was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.

Oligomeric structures, common to many neurodegenerative disease-related proteins, may in fact be the primary toxic species, while the amyloid fibrils exist either as a less toxic dead-end species or even as a beneficial mechanism for clearing damaged proteins. To alter the progression of the aggregation and gain insights into the prefibrillar structures, we determined the effect of heme on Syn oligomerization by several different techniques, including native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, and membrane permeation using a calcein release assay. During aggregation, heme is able to bind the Syn in a specific fashion, stabilizing distinct oligomeric conformations and promoting the formation of Syn into annular structures, thereby delaying and/or inhibiting the fibrillation process. These results indicate that heme may play a regulatory role in the progression of Parkinson's disease; in addition, they provide insights into how the aggregation process may be altered, which may be applicable to the understanding of many neurodegenerative diseases.","output":"What role does heme play in the progression of Parkinson's disease according to the passage?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. LANGHORNE, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania township with more money than it anticipated from increased property tax collection has decided to give the dividends to residents.      Middletown Township in Langhorne sent 14,361 checks for 68 each to all owners of properties with structures on them.      Efforts to keep town expenses down while increasing delinquent-tax collection led to more money than anticipated in the general fund. The township board of supervisors decided to divide a 1 million portion of the surplus evenly among property owners.      Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Amy Strouse tells the Bucks County Courier Times it's irresponsible for a township to hang on to that level of funding when it has \\"the opportunity to help people out a little bit.\\"      Strouse says residents feel as though they pay too much in taxes. ||||| Supervisors in April voted to return 1 million from Middletown's general fund to 14,361 township property owners. Those owners were mailed 68 checks earlier this month.      Middletown officials ended up having a little extra cash in hand, and now, so do property owners in the township.      The township in early June sent 68 checks as one-time \\"financial appropriations\\" to 14,361 \\"owners of improved property\\" — in legal terms, anyone who owns township property that isn't vacant land, said Solicitor James Esposito.      The supervisors' April decision to let go of 1 million of its general fund followed a discussion among board members and some public speakers of the merit of sending the money back to taxpayers compared to keeping it in township coffers.      Officials supportive of the payments have pointed to what they see as Middletown's healthy general fund balance — 9,734,300, as of last year's end, on account of the township paying less than it budgeted for most expenditures — plus around 900,000 Keystone Collections recovered in delinquent earned income taxes.      In light of those figures, board vice Chairman Mike Ksiazek said the checks would be a way to reduce the \\"tremendous financial burden\\" township residents told him about while he was campaigning for office last year.      Ksiazek said it is his \\"sincere belief that, if it's prudent and financially responsible to do so, then at least some of that money should be returned,\\" and that he hopes it will spur property development and improvement.      Supervisor William Oettinger, the five-person board's lone vote against the payments, disagreed, calling them \\"completely uncalled for\\" and saying the township should instead use the money to hire more police and public works department employees.      Immediately after approving the checks in April, supervisors voted to appropriate money for hiring one new police officer and one new public works laborer.      \\"The status quo isn't good enough when you have department heads telling you they need more help, and we keep on shooting them down, or throwing them a bone now and then, 'Here's one cop there, here's a public works guy there' ... this just doesn't make any sense.\\"      Resident Nancy McCann addressed the board, saying, \\"I'd love to get the 70 back, that's fine with me ... but to give away money that you say we don't have to get additional police officers, I would hate to cut off our nose to spite our face.\\"      Supervisors Chairwoman Amy Strouse said the board has heard \\"loud and clear\\" from residents that they feel they pay too much in taxes. The board can strike a balance between giving residents relief and hiring new employees, she added.      \\"We are in a situation where the general fund balance has crept up over time, and I think it's irresponsible for a township to hang on to that level of funding when we have the opportunity to help people out a little bit,\\" she said. \\"And if 70 is going to help somebody out a little bit with their medical bills, with putting food on the table for the next month or making their mortgage payment, then that's not an opportunity that I'm willing to pass up.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Middletown Township in Langhorne, Pennsylvania had extra money because they collected more property taxes than they expected. So, the leaders of the town decided to share this extra money with the people who own houses and buildings there. They sent each of those owners a check for 68. They hoped this would help people with their expenses and encourage them to improve their properties. Some people disagreed with this decision and thought the money should be spent on hiring more police and workers for the town instead."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Is the air around Mark more or less dense than the air around Jackie?  Jackie and Mark are two friends who are spending a day at the beach. Jackie wants to go out on the boat to spend some time on the ocean, but Mark wants to lay out on the beach and relax. Since they can't agree, Jackie goes out on the boat alone while Mark stays behind on the beach.  Hint: In coastal regions, sea breezes and land breezes can be important factors in a location's prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater specific heat compared to land. As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2 millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of 8 knots (15 km/h) exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.","output":"In this situation, the air around Mark is less dense than the air around Jackie. The reason for this difference in air density is due to the effect of sea breezes and land breezes, which play an important role in coastal regions. When the sun heats up the land, due to its lower specific heat compared to water, the land surface temperature increases and in turn heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air above the land is less dense, causing it to rise and creating an area of lower pressure. Since Mark is on the beach, he is in an area where the air is warmer and less dense due to the heating of the land. On the other hand, the sea is warmed more slowly by the sun, and thus, the air above the sea is generally cooler. This cooler air has a higher sea-level pressure, which results in denser air. As Jackie is out on the boat over the ocean, the air surrounding her is cooler and denser. The pressure gradient between the ocean and the land establishes a sea breeze, causing the cooler and denser air above the sea to flow inland towards the lower pressure area on the land. Therefore, the air around Mark on the beach is less dense than the air around Jackie, who is out on the boat over the ocean."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What does a real estate agent typically do when describing homes? Possible A: charming, cover up, exaggerate, incompetent, smile  Why is \\"exaggerate\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Exaggerate\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because real estate agents may sometimes emphasize or embellish certain aspects of a property to make it more appealing to potential buyers. While a good real estate agent should always prioritize honesty and transparency, it is common for agents to use persuasive language and selective details to highlight the positive features of a home and downplay any negative aspects. In the context of describing homes, the term \\"exaggerate\\" suggests that the agent is providing an enhanced or embellished account of the property, but not necessarily being dishonest. This practice falls within the scope of marketing and requires a good understanding of the buyer's needs and preferences. The agent's goal is to make a successful sale and match their clients with suitable properties, so emphasizing the property's strong points can aid in achieving this objective. However, it's important to note that not all real estate agents will exaggerate while describing homes. When selecting a real estate agent, it's crucial to find someone who is trustworthy, knowledgeable, and has your best interests in mind."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.  Which team had a higher likelihood of their can exploding? Answer:","output":"Team A had a higher likelihood of their can exploding. When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, we learn that the motion of particles in a substance increases when heated, causing an increase in pressure due to faster and more frequent particle collisions with the walls of the container. In this case, the container is the unvented can of soup. When Team A heated the unvented can of soup, the increasing pressure within the can had no way of being released. As the temperature and pressure continued to rise inside the can, the pressure exerted on the walls of the container also increased. Eventually, the pressure could become too great for the can to withstand, causing it to explode. In contrast, Team B heated a can of soup that had been vented first, allowing the pressure to be released as the temperature within the can increased. This controlled release of pressure reduced the risk of the can exploding due to excessive pressure buildup.

One of which country's banknotes showed the composer Sibelius","output":"The country whose banknotes featured the composer Jean Sibelius was Finland. Jean Sibelius, born in 1865 and deceased in 1957, was a Finnish composer and violinist, who played a significant role in Finnish nationalism and became an integral part of the country's national identity. His music inspired patriotism and showcased Finland's rich cultural history and folklore. On the 100 Finnish markka banknote issued between 1986 and 2002, Jean Sibelius was depicted on the obverse side. This banknote demonstrated the country's appreciation and respect for Sibelius's substantial impact on Finnish music and culture. The reverse of the 100 markka note featured an abstract illustration of swans, inspired by his symphonic poem, 'The Swan of Tuonela,' which is a part of the suite called 'Lemminkäinen Suite,' Op. 22. Jean Sibelius's works include seven symphonies, symphonic poems such as 'Finlandia,' 'Tapiola,' 'The Oceanides,' 'Pohjola's Daughter,' and 'Karelia Suite,' choral music, chamber music, and more than 100 art songs. His compositions became soundtracks to important historical events and played an essential part in the cultural and political emergence of Finland. He embodied the Romantic Nationalist movement that took place in European music during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 2002, Finland adopted the euro as its official currency, and the Finnish markka became obsolete, thus ending the circulation of the 100 markka banknote featuring Sibelius. Although no longer in circulation, the banknote's design and cultural significance serve as reminders of the composer's role in shaping Finland's national identity and his lasting impact on the country's music and culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\"?

In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, the city was restituted to France in accordance with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \\"Fourteen Points\\" without a referendum. The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \\"les députés protestataires\\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France. At the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery, the clear winners were the Social Democrats; the city was the administrative capital of the region, was inhabited by many Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many Germans. This could explain the difference between the rural vote and the one in Strasbourg. After the war, many Germans left Strasbourg and went back to Germany; some of them were denounced by the locals or expelled by the newly appointed authorities. The Saverne Affair was vivid in the memory among the Alsatians.

Information:  - Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint (a type of chert unique to chalk) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).  - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Metatheria is a mammalian clade that includes all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals (such as sparassodontans). First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880, it is a slightly more inclusive group than the marsupials; it contains all of the living mammals with abdominal pouches (most female marsupials) as well as their more primitive ancestors and relatives. Metatherians are one of three main classes of extant mammals: monotremes (egg laying mammals like the platypus and the echidna), metatheria (or marsupials, which includes the three American orders (Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria) and the four Australasian orders (Notoryctemorphia, Dasyuromorphia, Peramelemorphia and Diprotodontia)), and the eutherians (or placental mammals) consisting of twenty-one orders, divided into four superorders. Metatherians belong to a subgroup of the northern tribosphenic mammal clade or Boreosphenida. They differ from all other mammals in certain morphologies like their dental formula, which includes about five upper and four lower incisors, a canine, three premolars, and four molars. Other morphologies include skeletal and anterior dentition, such as wrist and ankle apomorphies; all metatherians share derived pedal characters and calcaneal features.  - Didelphodon ( meaning \`\` two womb tooth '' ) is a genus of stagodont metatherians from the Late Cretaceous of North America .  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere.   - Sparassodonta is an extinct order of carnivorous metatherian mammals native to South America. They were once considered to be true marsupials, but are now thought to be either a sister taxon to them, or considerably distantly related, part of a separate clade of Gondwanan metatherians. A number of these mammalian predators closely resemble placental predators that evolved separately on other continents, and are cited frequently as examples of convergent evolution. They were first described by Florentino Ameghino, from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia. Sparassodonts were present throughout South America's long period of \\"splendid isolation\\" during the Cenozoic; during this time they shared the niches for large warm-blooded predators with the flightless terror birds. Previously, it was thought that these mammals died out in the face of competition from \\"more competitive\\" placental carnivorans during the Pliocene Great American Interchange, but more recent research has showed that sparassodonts died out long before eutherian carnivores arrived in South America (aside from procyonids).  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - The Caribbean Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by Mexico and Central America to the west and south west, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the north coast of South America.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year.  - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who did not take up singing seriously until 1937? is inside the article: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United..., can you guess it ?

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Background: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to  0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements....  Paragraph: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.

Build a movie plot around this: Does Dana work at the same dines Lauryn goes to? Yes A:","output":"Step 1: Establish the main characters Our two main characters are Dana, an employee at a local diner, and Lauryn, a regular customer at the diner. They will be the focus of our movie plot. Step 2: Establish the setting The story takes place primarily at the diner, which is located in a small town. The town has a close-knit community, and the diner is a popular spot for locals to gather and socialize. Step 3: Create a central conflict The central conflict of the story is whether Dana and Lauryn will develop a meaningful relationship outside of their customer-employee interactions at the diner. Step 4: Establish backstory Dana has been working at the diner for quite some time and has developed a close bond with many of the regular customers. She is well-liked, but she doesn't have many close friends outside of her workplace. Lauryn has been a loyal patron of the diner for years, but she recently experienced a major life event, such as a divorce or the loss of a loved one, that has left her feeling isolated and vulnerable. Step 5: Develop character arcs and relationships As the movie progresses, Dana and Lauryn begin to share more personal conversations during Lauryn's visits to the diner. They discover that they have a lot in common, and a supportive friendship develops between them. The two women must navigate their evolving relationship while balancing their roles at the diner and their own personal lives. Step 6: Introduce secondary characters Secondary characters include other diner employees and regular customers who offer support, humor, and wisdom as Dana and Lauryn's relationship deepens. These characters create a sense of community and help emphasize the importance of strong friendships and connections. Step 7: Create a climax The climax occurs when Dana and Lauryn face a significant challenge that tests the strength of their friendship, such as Dana being offered a job in another city that would force her to leave the diner and Lauryn. The two women must decide whether their bond is strong enough to withstand the distance or if they should prioritize their own individual paths. Step 8: Resolve the conflict Dana and Lauryn decide that their friendship is too valuable to risk and make the necessary sacrifices to remain in each other's lives. This might mean Dana turns down the job offer or Lauryn moves closer to Dana's new location. Together, they acknowledge that their connection goes beyond the diner and evolves into a lifelong bond. Step 9: Conclude the story The movie ends with a scene at the diner where Dana and Lauryn, along with the supporting cast of secondary characters, celebrate their friendship and commitment to one another. They reflect on the journey they've taken together and look forward to a future filled with support, love, and community. By following these steps, we have built a movie plot centered on the relationship between Dana and Lauryn and their connection to the diner, creating an engaging story about friendship, personal growth, and the power of community."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Macaroni and cheese is a classic comfort food that is loved by many. It is a dish consisting of macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, usually created by combining a roux, milk, and cheese. In Kenneth's case, despite his love for this delicious dish, he never learned how to make it. Recognizing the importance of sharing a meal with loved ones, and understanding that the preparation process can be a gratifying experience, Kenneth decided to ask his friend, Logan, for some help in the kitchen.  Logan, on the other hand, was a skilled cook with a wide range of culinary abilities, including the mastery of creating a decadent macaroni and cheese dish. He was flattered that Kenneth had asked him for help and agreed to lend a hand. Logan began by gathering all the necessary ingredients for the dish: macaroni pasta, butter, all-purpose flour, milk, and a blend of various cheeses, such as cheddar, mozzarella, and Monterey Jack. While boiling a pot of water for the macaroni, Logan took the time to educate Kenneth on each step of the cooking process. He started by demonstrating how to create a roux, which is a mixture of melted butter and flour that serves as the base for the sauce. He explained that the roux could be whisked into the milk to thicken the sauce – a crucial step for achieving a smooth and creamy macaroni and cheese dish.  Once the roux was ready and the pasta perfectly al dente, Logan began incorporating the cheese into the sauce. He showed Kenneth the importance of adding the cheese gradually, allowing each portion to melt and blend before adding the next, to avoid clumping and unevenness. Meanwhile, Kenneth was tasked with grating the cheese and greasing a baking dish, adding an extra layer of culinary knowledge to his repertoire. As the dish was nearing completion, Logan decided to incorporate some optional ingredients, such as breadcrumbs, and a variety of herbs and spices to enhance the dish's flavor and texture.  After seasoning the dish to perfection, Logan poured the cheesy pasta into the prepared baking dish and topped it with a generous layer of breadcrumbs. Then, he explained to Kenneth that baking the macaroni and cheese would create a golden, crisp crust that would contrast beautifully with the creamy interior. Once the dish was cooked to perfection, Logan and Kenneth sat down to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The entire process not only provided Kenneth with an opportunity to learn how to prepare a delicious macaroni and cheese dish but also helped strengthen the bond between the two friends, as they shared their love for food and newfound knowledge with each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","output":"The individual you are referring to is Prince George, Duke of Kent, who was the fourth son of Queen Mary and King George V. He was born on December 20, 1902, and was the younger brother of King Edward VIII and King George VI. Prince George held the title of Duke of Kent and was known for his involvement in various public and military duties. On August 25, 1942, Prince George, Duke of Kent, tragically died in the Dunbeath Air Crash. At that time, he was a serving member of the Royal Air Force, holding the rank of Air Commodore. Prince George was on board a Royal Air Force Short S.25 Sunderland flying boat (Serial No. W4026) as a part of a non-operational flight from Invergordon, Scotland, to Reykjavik, Iceland. The aircraft was carrying personnel and equipment to the British base situated in Reykjavik. Unfortunately, the aircraft crashed into Eagle's Rock, a hillside near Dunbeath, Caithness, Scotland, under uncertain circumstances. The impact resulted in the loss of all but one of the 15 crew members and passengers on board, with Flight Sergeant Andrew Jack being the sole survivor. This tragic event marks one of the earliest high-profile aviation accidents involving a member of the British royal family, and it continues to be remembered as a significant historical incident.

Your potential photographers will bring along a portfolio of their pictures to the interview. It’s important that you spend plenty of time looking through this in detail with your partner. Ask the photographer to give some context for the pictures, including asking about the style used, and the type of wedding it was.  The portfolio is a crucial document that gives you the best idea of what sort of style you photos will be getting. The pictures will have been carefully chosen to represent what the photographer considers her best work. Ask yourself if the pictures in the portfolio move you, or you think they capture the magic of the wedding.  Be sure to ask if the production values on the pictures in the portfolio are the same as in the deal you are discussing. Spend some time looking back through the notes you made during the interview to help you decide. These notes are a record of the interview that can give you a good idea of the impression you got from the photographer. You can compare the scores across the different shortlisted candidates with your partner, and evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses. Price will no doubt be a factor in your decision, but try to think carefully about the value of these photos to you. It will be hard to value them quantitatively, as they are a record of the biggest day of your life, which you will always look back on.

Keep in mind some basic questions, and discuss your response with your partner after the interview.  Ask yourself simply if you liked the photographer.

She was only 46 years old. O'Riordan was found unresponsive in her room at the London Hilton on Park Lane hotel and was pronounced dead at the scene. Later, an inquest into her death determined that she had accidentally drowned in the bathtub due to alcohol intoxication. Dolores had a history of struggling with her mental health and substance use, which may have contributed to the tragic incident. Born on September 6, 1971, in County Limerick, Ireland, Dolores O'Riordan achieved fame and success as the vocalist and songwriter of The Cranberries. Formed in 1989, the band skyrocketed to international acclaim in the '90s with their unique blend of alternative rock, post-punk, and jangle-pop. O'Riordan's distinctively ethereal and powerful voice, coupled with her deeply emotive and personal lyrics, was the driving force behind The Cranberries' success. The band's debut album, \\"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?,\\" was released in 1993 and featured their first major hit, \\"Linger.\\" Subsequent albums, such as 1994's \\"No Need to Argue\\" and 1996's \\"To the Faithful Departed,\\" solidified their status as one of the most important acts of the '90s.

Read this article and answer this question Coming off their home win over the Texans, the Falcons flew to LP Field for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Tennessee Titans. In the first quarter, Atlanta got off to a fast start as CB DeAngelo Hall returned a LenDale White fumble 56 yards for a touchdown. The Titans tied the game with RB Chris Brown getting a 3-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Falcons regained the lead with kicker Morten Andersen getting a 32-yard field goal. Tennessee ended the half with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 30-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Atlanta got their lead back with Andersen kicking a 28-yard field goal. However, the Titans took the lead with Bironas nailing a 40-yard field goal, along with DB Vincent Fuller intercepting QB Joey Harrington and returning it 76 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, with Harrington being ineffective (16/31 for 87 yards and 1 interception), back-up QB Byron Leftwich came to try to lead the Falcons to victory. Near the end of the game, Atlanta came close (at Tennessee's 1-yard line). On four-straight plays, they were held out of the end zone, with Albert Haynesworth making a leaping tackle of Warrick Dunn in the backfield after hurdling an offensive lineman. With the loss, not only did the Falcons fall to 1-4, but it also marked their fifth straight loss to the Titans.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How do I see who viewed my Instagram video? How can you tell who has viewed Instagram videos?","output":"While these two questions have slightly different wording, they essentially have the same meaning: both are inquiring about how to discern who has viewed a specific video on Instagram. Given the core subject matter of these questions – understanding the viewership of Instagram videos – we can delve into a more detailed analysis of the process involved. 1. Instagram Stories: If you have shared your video through Instagram Stories, you can easily see the list of viewers for that particular story. Here's how:    a. Open the Instagram app and navigate to your profile.    b. Tap on the \\"Stories\\" icon, which should display your active stories.    c. Swipe up on the story containing the video of interest. This action will reveal a list of all viewers for that specific story, along with the total view count. Note that this information is only available for 24 hours after first posting the video, as Instagram stories are temporary content. After the 24-hour window, the video will no longer be accessible to your audience. 2. Instagram Feed (Posts): If you have posted the video to your main Instagram feed, the process for identifying specific viewers is different and, unfortunately, not possible. Instagram does not provide this information for videos shared on your feed. However, you can still gather some insights about your video's performance:    a. Open the Instagram app and navigate to the video post on your profile.    b. Below the video, you should see both the number of likes and number of views it has received. Note that views represent the total times users have watched your video, while likes indicate direct engagement.    c. By tapping on the number of likes, you can access a list of users who liked your post – while not inclusive of everyone who viewed it, this will offer a glimpse into your video's audience. 3. Instagram Insights: For business profiles and creator accounts, Instagram offers an analytics tool called \\"Insights.\\" This platform provides in-depth information about your account's performance, including engagement and reach metrics for your posts and stories:    a. Open your Instagram profile and tap on the menu in the top-right corner, denoted by three horizontal lines.    b. Select \\"Insights\\" from the menu.    c. Explore the insights, paying particular attention to the sections for \\"Content\\" and \\"Audience.\\" While these features don't provide a list of specific users who viewed your videos, they offer valuable data for assessing your account activity and engagement levels with your audience. In conclusion, while the two original questions' phrasing differs, they both address the issue of discerning viewership for Instagram videos. As described, the process varies depending on whether the video in question is part of an Instagram story or a feed post. For more significant data analysis – specific to business or creator accounts – Instagram Insights can provide additional insights, though it still won't disclose the identities of specific viewers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: Where did painters meet?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Joseph Gilles Henri Villeneuve (French pronunciation:  [Zil vilnoev]; January 18, 1950 - May 8, 1982), known as Gilles Villeneuve, was a Canadian racing driver. Villeneuve spent six years in Grand Prix racing with Ferrari, winning six races and widespread acclaim for his performances. An enthusiast of cars and fast driving from an early age, Villeneuve started his professional career in snowmobile racing in his native province of Quebec. Context: At the funeral in Berthierville former teammate Jody Scheckter delivered a simple eulogy: \\"I will miss Gilles for two reasons. First, he was the most genuine man I have ever known. Second, he was the fastest driver in the history of motor racing. But he has not gone. The memory of what he has done, what he achieved, will always be there.\\"  Villeneuve is still remembered at Grand Prix races, especially those in Italy. At the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, the venue of the San Marino Grand Prix, a corner was named after him and a Canadian flag is painted on the third slot on the starting grid, from which he started his last race. There is also a bronze bust of him at the entrance to the Ferrari test track at Fiorano. At Zolder the corner where Villeneuve died has been turned into a chicane and named after him.  The racetrack on Notre Dame Island, Montreal, host to the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix, was named Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in his honour at the Canadian Grand Prix of 1982. His homeland has continued to honour him: In Berthierville a museum was opened in 1992 and a lifelike statue stands in a nearby park which was also named in his honour. Villeneuve was inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame at their inaugural induction ceremony at the Four Seasons Hotel, Toronto, Ontario on August 19, 1993. He was also inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1983. In June 1997 Canada issued a postage stamp in his honour.  There is still a huge demand for Villeneuve memorabilia at the race-track shops and several books have been written about him. The number 27, the number of his Ferrari in 1981 and 1982, is still closely associated with him by fans. Jean Alesi, whose aggression and speed in the wet were compared to Villeneuve's, also used the number at Ferrari. Villeneuve's son, Jacques, drove the #27 during his IndyCar and Indianapolis 500 winning season with Team Green, and has also used the number for occasional drives in NASCAR and the Speedcar Series. Canadian driver Andrew Ranger used number 27 in the 2005 and 2006 Champ Car seasons, and continued using the number at NASCAR Canadian Tire Series since 2007. Canadian driver and 2011 IndyCar Rookie of the Year James Hinchcliffe adopted the number 27 for the 2012 season when he joined Andretti Autosport (former Andretti Green Racing).  A film based on the biography by Gerald Donaldson was announced in 2005, to be produced by Capri Films Inc, and with Christian Duguay named as the director, but the film has yet to materialise. Question: How else is he honoured? Answer:","output":"Gilles Villeneuve is honored in many ways for his achievements and contributions to the world of racing.

Having a list of affirmations can help keep your self-esteem stable and help you face challenging situations with more confidence. 7. Reach out to a support system: If you feel overwhelmed or need someone to talk to, reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. It's essential to have a support system in place to help you navigate through difficult moments. 8. Be mindful of self-care: Make sure you're taking care of your physical and emotional well-being throughout the day. This includes getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising, and engaging in enjoyable activities. 9. Practice exposure therapy: Gradually expose yourself to social situations that cause anxiety.

The statement provides an insight into the recent history of the tourist industry in the Cete region, mentioning that in recent years it has expanded westward. However, no specific timeline is provided to determine if this expansion happened precisely a century ago.  To better understand the situation, let's analyze the different aspects of the statement, starting by defining the key terms and discussing the growth and development of the tourist industry in the Cete region. 1. The Cete: Traditionally, the Cete has been a popular coastal region located in the south of France, known for its stunning beaches, picturesque towns, and luxury tourism industry. It is often referred to as the French Riviera, or Côte d'Azur in French. 2. Saint-Raphaël, Sainte-Maxime, and Saint-Tropez: These are three coastal towns situated along the Mediterranean coast of the French Riviera. Saint-Raphaël and Sainte-Maxime are widely recognized for their family-friendly atmosphere, while Saint-Tropez is renowned for its glamour, attracting numerous celebrities, artists, and wealthy travelers. 3. Tourist industry expansion: The statement suggests that recent years have brought about changes in the tourist industry in the Cete region, with more focus given to the western part of the area. This shift has allowed popular resorts like Saint-Raphaël, Sainte-Maxime, and Saint-Tropez to flourish, showcasing the diversity that the French Riviera can offer to travelers. Based on this information, it is clear that there has been a westward expansion of the tourist industry in the Cete region. However, it is important to note that the statement refers to this expansion as a recent event, which indicates that it has occurred within the past few decades, rather than precisely a century ago. Without additional information regarding the exact timeline of this development, we cannot definitively conclude that the Cete was extended westward over a century ago. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the tourist industry along the French Riviera has evolved over time. While the region was initially known for its lavish resorts targeting the wealthy, it has made an effort to adapt to the changing demands of travelers, and now offers a wider variety of accommodations and experiences catering to various preferences and budgets. The inclusion of Saint-Raphaël, Sainte-Maxime, and Saint-Tropez as part of the larger Cete region exemplifies this trend. In conclusion, although the tourist industry in the Cete region has indeed expanded westward to include popular family-style resorts like Saint-Raphaël and Sainte-Maxime, and the glamorous Saint-Tropez, there is not enough information to support the claim that this extension took place over a century ago. A further exploration of the history of the French Riviera's tourist industry, along with a clear timeline of its development, would be necessary to draw a more accurate conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and grew up in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Although Wayne and Birdman have a father-son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Wayne's biological father and namesake (Dwayne Carter) is still alive. In the summer of 2004, Wayne's album Tha Carter was released, marking what critics considered advancement in his rapping style and lyrical themes. In addition, the album's cover art featured the debut of Wayne's now-signature dreadlocks. Tha Carter gained Wayne significant recognition, selling 878,000 copies in the United States, while the single \\"Go DJ\\" became a Top 5 Hit on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart. After the release of Tha Carter, Lil Wayne was featured in Destiny's Child's single \\"Soldier\\" with T.I., which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.  Tha Carter II, the follow-up to the original Tha Carter album, was released in December 2005, this time without production by longtime Cash Money Records producer Mannie Fresh, who had since left the label. Tha Carter II sold more than 238,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and went on to sell 2,000,000 copies worldwide. The lead single \\"Fireman\\" became a hit in the US, peaking at 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Other singles included \\"Grown Man\\" with Currensy, \\"Hustler Musik\\", and \\"Shooter\\" with R&B singer Robin Thicke. Lil Wayne also appeared on a remix of Bobby Valentino's \\"Tell Me\\", which rose to No. 13 on the U.S. R&B Charts. In 2005, Lil Wayne was named president of Cash Money, and in the same year he founded Young Money Entertainment as an imprint of Cash Money. However, as of late 2007, Lil Wayne reported that he has stepped down from the management of both labels and has handed management of Young Money over to Cortez Bryant.  In 2006, Lil Wayne collaborated with rapper Birdman for the album Like Father, Like Son, whose first single \\"Stuntin' Like My Daddy\\", reached No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Since he lacks originality he must rely on quotation. Does the word \\"quotation\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"No, the word \\"quotation\\" does not mean the same thing in the two sentences provided. In this context, \\"quotation\\" has two different meanings. Let me provide a detailed explanation for each usage. 1. In the first sentence: \\"Let's get a quotation for repairing the roof before we decide whether it's worth doing.\\" In this context, \\"quotation\\" refers to a formal statement issued by a contractor or service provider, which outlines the services to be performed, the cost of labor and materials, and the timeframe for completion. In essence, a quotation is a document that provides detailed information about a job price and the scope of work involved. People often request quotations from multiple service providers when they are considering a project, so they can compare prices, services, and timelines before making a decision. In this sentence, the speaker is suggesting obtaining a quotation for repairing the roof to determine if it's a financially viable option. 2. In the second sentence: \\"Since he lacks originality, he must rely on quotation.\\" In this context, \\"quotation\\" refers to the act of using someone else's words, often a well-known phrase or expression, without altering or adding anything original. This type of quotation is common in writing, speeches, and conversation, where people draw upon the words of others to support, emphasize, or illustrate their points. However, when used excessively or in lieu of one's own thoughts and ideas, relying on quotations can imply a lack of creativity or originality. In summary, the word \\"quotation\\" has two different meanings in the given sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to a formal document containing information about a job's cost and scope of work, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of using someone else's words as a means to convey a point or idea. These distinct meanings demonstrate the versatility and nuance of the English language, where a single word can have multiple meanings depending on the context in which it is used."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The next giant leap for mankind is to reach another planet - specifically, Mars. The problem is that it's no easy task. The planet is 586 times further away from the Earth than the moon, and it'll take around 180 to 220 days to reach Mars, depending on where each planet is in its orbit. Such long periods in space have suggested many potential health problems, including hormonal changes, skin conditions, and muscle and bone deterioration  . Here's where some furry friends come in. A wide range of animals have been in space, from fruit flies and spiders to cats, and dogs. Such experiments began as far back as the late 1940s in first tests to see if living things could _ the extreme g-force   of a rocket launch. Mice continue to play a very important part in space experiments, mainly because the animals make excellent test subjects. They're small, which makes them inexpensive and easy to care for. In addition, their size and short life span make it possible to do the equivalent of several human years of tests in a much shorter time. Finally, because mice are mammals, they share many common characteristics with humans in terms of genetics, biology and behavior. Astromice have hit the headlines recently, as a team of scientists led by Betty Nusgens, professor of biology at the University of Liege in Belgium, found that the mice suffered a 15 percent thinning of their skin after 91 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS). This experiment was part of a wider NASA mission   called the Mice Drawer System (MDS). The Italian Space Agency developed the facility, which allows six mice to be housed, monitored, and automatically fed and watered aboard the ISS, among which three survived during the mission. The mice have participated in 20 separate experiments, to study such effects as osteoporosis  , anemia   and heart health. Results for the 20 experiments are coming in...

New chief executive Alison Brittain said the results reflected a \\"successful\\" year, that demonstrated \\"the strength of our businesses\\". Whitbread has faced calls recently to split up its various brands. The company has lost almost a third of its share price since December when Ms Brittain replaced Andy Harrison as chief executive. Last year, a new managing director was put in charge of the company's hotels and restaurants division, which also includes the Brewers Fayre and Beefeater Grill chains. And last week, Whitbread announced that Christopher Rogers, the head of the Costa division, would step down to be replaced by Dominic Paul from cruise giant Royal Caribbean International. The UK's frothy coffee market has been expanding, with branded outlets such as Costa, Starbucks and Caffe Nero accounting for a 15% rise in sales over 2015, according to research firm Allegra. \\"Costa is busily slaking the nation's never ending thirst for caffeine,\\" says Steve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown. \\"Think of it as an investment play on the UK's long hours work culture.\\" This period of continued growth - with some analysts saying \\"peak coffee\\" has been reached - has prompted some investors to call for Whitbread to sell Costa now, to get as much value from the brand as possible. High Street competitors such as Greggs are trying to move in to this profitable market, by significantly undercutting Costa's coffee prices. Ms Brittain insisted that Whitbread did not need to raise coffee prices to fund improved pay for staff and increased investment in IT infrastructure. \\"I think there are other ways of us achieving this,\\" she told the BBC, and that it was \\"really important\\" to continue to offer, \\"a lower price point for coffee than our competitors\\".

Write a title for this article: LONDON — The topsy-turvy politics of Britain’s endlessly unpredictable summer took another stunning twist on Monday, with the selection by default of a prime minister who had advocated staying in the European Union but will now come under immediate pressure to fulfill her promise to lead the nation’s exit. Theresa May, the hard-charging home affairs secretary, was elevated to Britain’s top job when the woman who was to spend the summer campaigning against her, Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, preemptively dropped out of the contest to succeed outgoing leader David Cameron. With only one candidate left in the race, the 59-year-old May was named the winner by acclaim, a decision met with table-thumping approval by her fellow Tories in Parliament. She will take the keys to 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, once Cameron has had a final turn in the weekly political combat session known as Prime Minister’s Questions. By coalescing around May, her Conservative Party avoided what could have been a bruising months-long campaign that threatened to inflame the still-raw wounds of last month’s E.U. referendum. But the move is also likely to accelerate the pressure on Britain to exit the E.U. European leaders have said Britain must act as quickly as possible to get out, as have Leadsom and other British advocates for a geopolitics-rattling divorce known as Brexit. On Wednesday, Theresa May will become Britain’s next prime minister. She'll become the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher. Here's what you need to know her in 60 seconds. (Karla Adam,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) May campaigned — if only barely — for the country to stay inside the E.U. But after the “leave” campaign won last month’s referendum and forced the pro-“remain” Cameron from office, May pivoted and said she would back an exit — a stance she reiterated in her victory speech. “Brexit means Brexit, and we are going to make a success of it,” she said Monday afternoon as she stood in front of the gothic towers of Westminster and flashed a smile that is seldom seen on a politician known for her no-nonsense demeanor. [As Britain looks to new leader, a jolt of pressure to speed Brexit] May will become the country’s 76th prime minister, but only the second woman to hold the job following Margaret Thatcher, who stepped down over a quarter-century ago. Although May has been occasionally likened to Thatcher — Britain’s Iron Lady — she has lately been compared to a more contemporary leader: German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both May and Merkel were born in the 1950s, the daughters of church pastors. They both inhabit the center-right of European politics but are also known for a strong pragmatic streak. Both are also considered tough negotiators — skills they’ll be putting to use against one another as May seeks a divorce deal with her soon-to-be-former E.U. counterparts. The key question now is when she triggers the start of those talks. She had earlier said she did not want to invoke Article 50 — the never-before-used mechanism for exiting the E.U. — until at least 2017. Her reluctance to move faster has sparked speculation that she might try to find a way to avoid Brexit — a possibility she emphatically rejected Monday, saying that there would be “no attempts to remain inside the E.U., no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, and no second referendum.” Monday’s events make it less likely that she can go back on that pledge, even if she wants to. In dropping out of the race, Leadsom emphasized that she was trying to clear a path for her erstwhile rival to get on with the business of Brexit. The two were supposed to campaign through the summer for the affection of the Conservative Party’s 150,000 members, with the winner due to be announced Sept. 9. [Meet Theresa May on her way to 10 Downing Street] But Leadsom, a relative unknown whose campaign got off to a rocky start after she touted her motherhood as an advantage in a matchup with the childless May, said Monday that she had concluded that “a nine-week leadership campaign at such a critical moment for our country is highly undesirable.” “Business needs certainty,” she said as she stood in front of a dark-brick townhouse in central London. Just last week, Leadsom had earned the right to square off against May in the summer contest by placing second — far behind May — among Conservative members of Parliament. May was considered a strong favorite to win, but Leadsom had vowed to wage a tough campaign. Her decision to drop out came as yet another shock in a country where such remarkable turnabouts have become a regular feature of politics. Since voting last month to leave the E.U. — the biggest stunner of all — Britain has watched mouth agape as politicians have double-crossed each other, scores have been settled and May has emerged from near the back of the pack of prime ministerial candidates to be the only woman left standing. By dropping out, Leadsom triggered a cascade of fast-moving developments. First, May’s former rivals lined up behind her. Michael Gove, the justice secretary who finished third in last week’s winnowing of candidates, quickly endorsed May on Monday. So did Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and a one-time Leadsom backer. Hours later, Cameron walked out the front door of 10 Downing Street for one of the last times, and announced to reporters that he would yield to May by Wednesday. “I’m delighted that Theresa May will be the next prime minister. She is strong, she is competent, she is more than able to provide the leadership that our country is going to need in the years ahead, and she will have my full support,” Cameron said. Cameron said he would chair his last cabinet meeting Tuesday and would attend Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday for a final time as the nation’s leader, six years after he took the job. “After that, I expect to go to the palace and offer my resignation, so we will have a new prime minister in that building behind me by Wednesday evening,” he said. On his way back to Downing Street, the still-mic’d-up Cameron hummed a happy tune. A little over an hour later, in brief remarks beside cheering Conservative lawmakers outside Parliament, May promised to “steer us through what will be difficult and uncertain political and economic times.” May, who had raced back to London after a campaign event in Birmingham, appeared to have been caught off guard by Leadsom’s withdrawal — as was nearly everyone in British politics. [The rise of Theresa May highlights Brexit’s greatest irony] May will take office under the mandate that the Conservative Party gained in last year’s general election, having won a narrow majority in Parliament. But the abrupt end of the leadership contest deprives her of the explicit endorsement she was expected to receive from the party’s rank-and-file members. May had earlier said she believed that it was important that the party have a choice in its new leader and that she not take power through “a coronation.” Opposition parties quickly seized on the fact that voters hadn’t had the chance to pick May. The veteran politician is considered to the right of Cameron, having taken a hard line on issues such as immigration and government surveillance. “Tories now have no mandate,” tweeted Tim Farron, leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, in a call for new elections. “Britain deserves better than this.” Politicians from the center-left Labour Party joined Farron’s call. But they did so as Labour continued its weeks-long implosion. Angela Eagle, a former top deputy of party leader Jeremy Corbyn, announced Monday that she would challenge Corbyn for his job. Dissidents within Labour, including Eagle, say Corbyn is ill-equipped to lead the party in a general election if the Conservatives decide to call one to renew their mandate. May has said there will be no new vote. But in a season of constant surprise, British political observers say not to rule it out.

Q:Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows.

Background: Katherine Anne \\"Kitty\\" Pryde is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. The character first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #129 (January 1980) and was co-created by writer-artist John Byrne and Chris Claremont. A mutant, Pryde possesses a \\"phasing\\" ability that allows her, as well as objects or people she is in contact with, to become intangible. This power also disrupts any electrical field she passes through, and lets her simulate levitation. Context: Katherine Anne \\"Kitty\\" Pryde was born in Deerfield, Illinois, to Carmen and Theresa Pryde. Of Jewish descent, her paternal grandfather, Samuel Prydeman, was held in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. Kitty started to have headaches at age thirteen, signaling the emergence of her mutant powers. She was approached by both the X-Men's Charles Xavier and the Hellfire Club's White Queen, Emma Frost, both of whom hoped to recruit her for their respective causes. Kitty was unnerved by Frost, observing that the White Queen looked at her as if she were \\"something good to eat.\\" She got along better with Xavier and the three X-Men who escorted him, quickly becoming friends with Ororo Munroe. Ororo told Kitty who she really was and about the X-Men, which made the teenager even more enthusiastic about attending Xavier's school.  Their conversation was cut short when they (along with Wolverine and Colossus) were attacked by armored mercenaries in the employ of Frost and the Hellfire Club. The X-Men defeated their assailants, but were subdued by the White Queen's telepathic powers immediately after. In the confusion, Kitty was separated from the X-Men, and not captured along with them. She managed to contact Cyclops, Phoenix, and Nightcrawler. With the help of Dazzler and Pryde, those X-Men rescued their teammates from the Hellfire Club.  The White Queen appeared to perish in the battle, which meant she was no longer competing with Xavier for the approval of Kitty's parents. Kitty's parents had not heard from her in more than a day, because during that time she was first being pursued by the Hellfire Club's men and then working with the X-Men to save their friends. All they knew was Kitty had left with Xavier's \\"students\\" to get a soda, there had been reports that the soda shop had been blown up, and Kitty had been missing since. Therefore, they were angry at Xavier when he finally returned with Kitty in tow. At first, it seemed like there was no chance of Kitty being allowed to attend the school and join the X-Men. Phoenix then used her considerable telepathic power to erase the memories of Kitty's parents and plant false ones, resulting in a complete shift in their attitude towards Xavier. Kitty was then allowed to enroll at Xavier's school with her parents' blessing, becoming the youngest member of the team. Question: What were her mutant powers Answer:","output":"Kitty Pryde's mutant powers allow her to \\"phase\\" through solid objects. This means she, and anything or anyone she touches, can become see-through and pass through walls or other things like a ghost. Her powers also mess up electrical fields, like the power in a room, and let her pretend to float or levitate."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Military sources say the Syrian army now has \\"full control\\" after days of fighting backed by Russian air strikes. Meanwhile, Syria's antiquities chief said the damage to the ancient city was less than previously feared. \\"We were expecting the worst. But the landscape, in general, is in good shape,\\" Maamoun Abdulkarim told the AFP news agency. He said he felt \\"indescribable joy\\" that the city had not been completely destroyed. An on-the-ground assessment of the destruction will be carried out in coming days in order to develop restoration plans, Mr Abdulkarim said. More images of the damage caused by IS have emerged since Palmyra's recapture. President Assad said the recapture of Palmyra showed the success of the army's strategy. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Mr Assad, a Kremlin spokesman said. The Kremlin said President Assad knew the Palmyra operation \\"would have been impossible without Russia's support\\". Why IS militants destroy ancient sites Palmyra and the logic of loss IS seized the Unesco World Heritage site and modern town in May 2015. Palmyra is situated in a strategically important area on the road between the capital, Damascus, and the contested eastern city of Deir al-Zour. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said at least 400 IS fighters were killed in the battle for Palmyra. In a statement released on Saturday, Russia's defence ministry said its strikes hit 158 IS targets, killing more than 100 militants. This is a victory for President Bashar al-Assad, who wants to show the world that he is a partner in fighting terrorism. Backed by Russian war planes and Shia militias, government forces gained control over the ancient city and are now close to securing a vast area of the country. But residents and observers cast doubts on why Mr Assad's forces pulled out from Palmyra in the first place, allowing Islamic State militants to get in to the city. In May 2015, hundreds of IS fighters drove hundreds of kilometres across the desert to reach Palmyra, almost uninterrupted, while government forces were dropping barrel bombs over opposition areas full of civilians. President Assad has now secured a stronger position in the peace talks. He is certainly seen as a problem-solver, but many say he is the source of the problem. When IS seized the city it destroyed archaeological sites, drawing global outrage. Two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers were left in ruins. The jihadist group, which has also demolished several pre-Islamic sites in neighbouring Iraq, believes that such structures are idolatrous.

Context: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

The Lenape (English:  or ), also called the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in Canada and the United States. Their historical territory included present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, New York City, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. Today, Lenape people belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Wisconsin, and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario. The Lenape have a matrilineal clan system and historically were matrilocal. New Amsterdam was founded in 1624 by the Dutch in what would later become New York City. Dutch settlers also founded a colony at present-day Lewes, Delaware on June 3, 1631 and named it Zwaanendael (Swan Valley). The colony had a short life, as in 1632 a local band of Lenape killed the 32 Dutch settlers after a misunderstanding escalated over Lenape defacement of the insignia of the Dutch West India Company. In 1634, the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock went to war with the Lenape over access to trade with the Dutch at New Amsterdam. They defeated the Lenape, and some scholars believe that the Lenape may have become tributaries to the Susquehannock. After the warfare, the Lenape referred to the Susquehannock as \\"uncles.\\" The Iroquois added the Lenape to the Covenant Chain in 1676; the Lenape were tributary to the Five Nations (later Six) until 1753, shortly before the outbreak of the French and Indian War (a part of the Seven Years' War in Europe).  The Lenape's quick adoption of trade goods, and their need to trap furs to meet high European demand, resulted in their disastrous over-harvesting of the beaver population in the lower Hudson Valley. With the fur sources exhausted, the Dutch shifted their operations to present-day upstate New York. The Lenape who produced wampum in the vicinity of Manhattan Island temporarily forestalled the negative effects of the decline in trade. Lenape population fell sharply during this period, due to high fatalities from epidemics of infectious diseases carried by Europeans, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity, as the diseases had arisen on the Asian continent and moved west into Europe, where they had become endemic in the cities.  The Lenape had a culture in which the clan and family controlled property. Europeans often tried to contract for land with the tribal chiefs, confusing their culture with that of neighboring tribes such as the Iroquois. The Lenape would petition for grievances on the basis that not all their families had been recognized in the transaction (not that they wanted to \\"share\\" the land). After the Dutch arrival in the 1620s, the Lenape were successful in restricting Dutch settlement until the 1660s to Pavonia in present-day Jersey City along the Hudson. The Dutch finally established a garrison at Bergen, which allowed settlement west of the Hudson within the province of New Netherland. This land was purchased from the Lenape after the fact.  In 1682, William Penn and Quaker colonists created the English colony of Pennsylvania beginning at the lower Delaware River. A peace treaty was negotiated between the newly arriving English and Lenape at what is now known as Penn Treaty Park. In the decades immediately following, some 20,000 new colonists arrived in the region, putting pressure on Lenape settlements and hunting grounds. Although Penn endeavored to live peaceably with the Lenape and to create a colony that would do the same, he also expected his authority and that of the colonial government to take precedence. His new colony effectively displaced many Lenape and forced others to adapt to new cultural demands. Penn gained a reputation for benevolence and tolerance, but his efforts resulted in more effective colonization of the ancestral Lenape homeland than previous ones.

The film was originally released in the US in 1980 as Goliathon . The film was directed by Ho Meng Hua and produced by Runme Shaw ; the special effects were directed by Sadamasa Arikawa , with Koichi Kawakita as assistant FX director . It starred Danny Lee and Evelyne Kraft .  - Pinyin, or Hàny Pnyn, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is often used to teach Standard Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters. The system includes four diacritics denoting tones. Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters.  - Homo erectus (meaning \\"upright man\\", from the Latin \\"rigere\\", \\"to put up, set upright\\") is an extinct species of hominid that lived throughout most of the Pleistocene geological epoch. Its earliest fossil evidence dates to 1.9 million years ago and the most recent to 70,000 years ago. It is generally thought that \\"H. erectus\\" originated in Africa and spread from there, migrating throughout Eurasia as far as Georgia, India, Sri Lanka, China and Indonesia.  - Peking Man, \\"Homo erectus pekinensis\\" (formerly known by the junior synonym \\"Sinanthropus pekinensis\\"), is an example of \\"Homo erectus\\".

More than 2,000 referees - the majority at grassroots level - responded to questions about the abuse they receive and how well the Football Association's Respect programme is working. Nearly one in five said they had experienced physical abuse. \\"There is no room for complacency and we remain vigilant,\\" said the FA. It told the BBC: \\"More extreme incidents such as referee assaults thankfully remain few and far between. \\"Across an estimated 1.2 million games last season the number of reported incidents amounted to a tiny fraction of 1% - which puts the scale of the problem into context.\\" But Dr Jamie Cleland from the University of Loughborough, one of the academics involved in the research, warned: \\"These findings are quite concerning for the FA because without referees the grassroots game would not exist. \\"Referees are the bedrock of the amateur game because you need a referee to turn up in order for the match to go ahead and so these are a warning sign for the FA.\\" Case study: 'He threatened to kill me' The 5 live Investigates programme has been given exclusive access to the research, which was carried out by academics at Loughborough, Portsmouth and Edge Hill universities. A total of 2,026 referees across England, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey responded to the survey. Thirty-two percent are currently at Level 7 - junior referees aged 16 or over. The second biggest response, 30%, was from those at Level 5 - senior county referees. The survey also included a small number of responses from referees within the Football and Premier Leagues. Findings reveal that 22% experience verbal abuse at every match, while 38% said they were abused every couple of games. In addition, 19% had been the victim of physical abuse at some time. Donald Distin from Devon, who has been a referee for 15 years, was attacked by a player as he showed a red card during a game last year. \\"He just punched me. My feet left the ground and I was on the floor,\\" Mr Distin told the programme. \\"The bruising went all the way down through my chest and my face. My eye was bloodshot - it was horrific. I couldn't see my grandson because he was so upset.\\" The player was subsequently jailed over the attack. Mr Distin told the programme he still experiences abuse at matches. \\"I did a game the other day - it was a local derby and there were 10 cautions and two sending-offs. I sent someone off the field of play and he came towards me and said 'I'm going to kill you', as well as a load of expletives.\\" During the 2014-15 season there were 100 assaults on match officials and 374 incidents of improper conduct including physical contact and threatening and/or abusive language. Officials were also asked about the FA's Respect Programme which began seven years ago to improve behaviour among players and spectators. More than half, 54%, said the campaign had been successful. Comments included: \\"Respect levels, in general, have been very good from my experience. The knowledge of the Respect campaign has been good at most clubs.\\" Another said: \\"I referee adult football and there has been a marked improvement in behaviour. There are fewer incidents of irrational behaviour.\\" But nearly a third felt that the campaign had been unsuccessful. \\"What we've seen from within the data is a real outpouring of emotion from referees. They are saying that the campaign has been somewhat successful but they are then providing a diary-like analysis of the experiences that they are receiving if not at every match, every couple of matches,\\" added Dr Cleland. One official told the survey: \\"Behaviour of players and coaches has not improved in the slightest and all this shaking of hands pre-match is meaningless, totally meaningless.\\" Another added: \\"At the level I referee, I don't believe the Respect campaign has made much of a difference. The behaviour of players and spectators, shouting, swearing etc, if anything has got worse since I started refereeing.\\" An FA spokesperson told 5 live Investigates that \\"incidents of dissent are never pleasant and the notion that they are in any way part and parcel of the game is one that the Respect Programme was established to dispel\\". The spokesperson highlighted a 23% decline in dissent cautions over the past seven seasons and added: \\"With a significant drop in the occurrence of this type of caution over the life of the programme, it is clearly working.\\" But they also conceded that one serious assault is one too many. \\"The FA engages directly with referees through its own research and gave its support to the independent study which - when drilled down - indicates that only 7% of referees feel that Respect isn't working outright.\\" Summary:","output":"A recent survey involving over 2,000 football referees found that 19% had experienced physical abuse, with the majority of respondents working at the grassroots level, raising concerns over the effectiveness of the Football Association's Respect programme."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Negative Movie Review: Ugh, I could barely sit through the film. I had high expectations after hearing so many people claim that I would be \\"blown away\\" by the intriguing plot, but it ended up being one of the most colossal disappointments I've ever encountered. To be honest, I am not entirely sure how anyone could find anything redeeming about this mess of a film. From the minute the opening credits rolled, I could tell that the production was going to be shoddy at best. The visuals were grainy, giving the impression the entire piece was haphazardly thrown together at the last minute. It's quite baffling to imagine that a movie with such a promising cast could be so poorly executed. Speaking of the cast, I was utterly confused by the mismatched ensemble of characters who were left to flounder in their half-baked roles. Their talents were criminally wasted in the screenplay, which seemed like it had been written by a first-time screenwriter rather than the seasoned professional the studio had hired. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, and honestly, made me feel embarrassed for the actors. The plot was a convoluted mess that tried too hard to be edgy and mysterious but ended up becoming a tangled web of cliches and inexplicable twists. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, hoping that the movie would end soon - I hadn't been this bored in a theater in years. The pacing dragged on and on, with scenes that felt dull and uninspired. Moreover, the movie's attempts to incorporate deeper themes and social commentary came across as incoherent and heavy-handed, leaving me with the impression that the filmmakers were merely throwing ideas against the wall in hope that something would stick. Everything about the plot felt forced and artificial, as if the goal was simply to shock people rather than to provide a meaningful or thought-provoking experience. Finally, the ending was possibly the most disappointing part, trying to deliver a twist that was painfully predictable and unoriginal, with the last few minutes feeling both rushed and underwhelming. I left the theater feeling frustrated and let down, wondering how such a fantastic concept could have been so thoroughly squandered. In conclusion, I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a well-crafted film experience, as it's a prime example of a missed opportunity that ends up wasting the audience's time and energy. The only positive takeaway I have is that I now have a new benchmark for true cinema failure. Disappointing, to say the least."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her name was Regina, and she was a blonde girl from Ukraine. Her eyes were like diamonds, and we had met at a party two days before. During my first morning, we had math class, PE and science. We didn't even have a break! I wondered why? Mrs Toalson said to us: \\"Guys, line up for the bathroom break please!\\" All the kids stood up and went outside. I didn't know what \\"bathroom break\\" meant. Was it break time? Lunch time? I was confused. Nevertheless, we followed Mrs. Toalson to the main building. We sat in the hallway across from the bathroom. In Chinese, \\"bathroom\\" means the WC, and a \\"break\\" means having a rest! Gosh, I thought that was weird and why did we have to go to the bathroom together? \\"Mary and Regina, you may go.\\" When we heard Mrs. Toalson, we went into the bathroom. The bathroom was clean, and it smelled like perfume. I asked Regina what if someone wanted to go to the bathroom during class time. She told me that there was a special pass called a \\"bathroom pass.\\" All you had to do was raise your hand with the pass to let Mrs. Toalson know you need to go to the bathroom. Then you would be permitted to go. At 3:30pm, school ended for the day. Students put their textbooks in their cabinets and lined up in front of the change room, where they collected their backpacks and coats. As they walked out of the door, each student said \\"Good bye\\" and gave Mrs. Toalson a high five. \\"Did you have a good day today?\\" Mrs. Toalson asked me as she hugged me goodbye. \\"Sure!\\" I nodded. Question: What does the author think of the first day in her new school? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Satisfying.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the author finds the first day in her new school \\"satisfying.\\" Step 1: Understand the context of the article. The article describes the author's first day at a new school and the various experiences they encountered, such as the bathroom break, American school practices, and interaction with fellow students and their teacher, Mrs. Toalson. Step 2: Analyze the author's feelings and reactions. Throughout the article, the author expresses their thoughts, including their confusion regarding some differences between American and Chinese school routines. However, the author does not express any negative feelings or dissatisfaction with their experience. Step 3: Assess the author's overall impression. In the final interaction, Mrs. Toalson asked the author if they had a good day, and the author replied with a nod and \\"Sure!\\" This response, along with the lack of any negative comments, suggests that the author found their first day in the new school satisfying."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This will prevent any irritation or stains on your hands from the soot. Step 2: Place a drop cloth, tarp, or plastic around your work area. This will serve as a protective layer for your floor or surrounding surfaces, as some soot and ash can dislodge from the bricks while cleaning, causing additional stains if not protected. Step 3: If you are working indoors or on delicate surfaces, place some newspapers on top of the drop cloth to help absorb sloshed water, drips from the sponge, or wet bottoms of buckets. Step 4: Start by using a metal or glass broom to sweep away any loose soot from the bricks. This will help reduce the amount of soot you will need to clean, making the overall process easier. Step 5: Sprinkle a very fine grit sand onto the sooty areas, starting with a small amount to avoid a rough distribution. This will help further loosen the soot from the bricks, making it easier to clean. Step 6: Gently rub and scrub the sooty bricks with a sponge dampened in warm water. Apply gentle pressure and use circular motions to help lift and remove the soot from the bricks. Step 7: Rinse the sponge regularly as you work to keep it clean and effective in removing soot. Make sure to wring out excess water to prevent dripping and unnecessary water damage. Step 8: As you continue cleaning, inspect the bricks for any remaining soot or stains. If there is still soot present, repeat steps 5-7 until the bricks are clean. Step 9: After the cleaning process is complete, use a clean, dry rag to wipe down the bricks and remove any residual soot and moisture. Step 10: Remove the drop cloth, tarp, or plastic, and clean up any remaining debris or water. Properly dispose of the soot and used cleaning materials. Remember to always handle soot with care, as it can be harmful if inhaled or ingested.

Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Value added tax. Yes or no? Answer: The value added to a product by or with a business is the sale price charged to its customer, minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs. Question: what is vat tax? A:","output":"Yes, your description of Value Added Tax (VAT) is correct. VAT is a consumption tax applied to goods and services at each stage of the supply chain, where value is added. The amount of VAT charged is based on the sale price charged to the customer, minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs. It is collected by businesses and paid to the government. In more detail, VAT is a type of indirect tax levied on the value added to goods and services at each stage of production and distribution. The tax is ultimately borne by the end consumer. Businesses collect VAT on their sales, and they can also claim credits on VAT that has been levied on their purchases of materials and services required for their business activities. The rate of VAT varies depending on the country and the type of goods or services provided. Most countries have a standard VAT rate, but some items may be taxed at reduced rates or exempted from VAT. When a business sells a product or service, it charges the customer the price of the item and the appropriate VAT. The business then calculates the VAT it owes to the government by subtracting the VAT paid on its purchases from the VAT collected from its sales. The difference is the amount of VAT the business must pay to the government. In summary, Value Added Tax (VAT) is a consumption tax applied to the sale of goods and services throughout the supply chain, with businesses collecting the tax on behalf of the government. The VAT charged is based on the sale price of the product or service, minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For now, they say, the Egypt-brokered de-escalation has merely placed a Band-Aid over a seeping wound, restoring the status quo established after Israel's Operation Cast Lead offensive of late 2008. Certainly, we may well see the return of airstrikes and rockets; the truce represents only a small first step toward a more durable solution. The nature of the agreement, however, points to a clear \\"Arab Spring truth\\" and a significant shift in regional dynamics: The international isolation of Hamas has ended. The influence exercised by Egypt, Turkey and Qatar was clearly instrumental in delivering this cease-fire. The role of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, in particular, has been praised by Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton alike, with the latter commending Egypt's government for \\"assuming responsibility and leadership\\" in de-escalating the crisis. Toward the end of 2011, Hamas' departure from Damascus was sealed when Meshaal refused to denounce the uprising against his former host and sponsor, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. With its regional base and Iranian funding in jeopardy, Hamas has increasingly turned to its fellow Sunni allies in Egypt, Turkey and Qatar. The degree of influence that this troika of Arab Spring playmakers has over Hamas' leaders, however, was revealed only by the recent crisis. The absence in negotiations of the Palestinian Authority and its president, Mahmoud Abbas, was telling. It shows that in a post-revolution Middle East, engagement with Hamas on its own is both feasible and tempting. Opinion: How to prevent the next clash with Hamas. In this respect, however, the Egyptian president missed the opportunity to get Abbas and Meshaal working together and further stalled efforts at Palestinian unity. That is the demand of the overwhelming majority of Palestinians. To be sure, Iran still has an important role to play with Hamas. Alongside Egypt -- and, remarkably, the U.S. -- Meshaal recognized on Wednesday the importance of Iran's contribution to his movement's efforts (in the field of resistance, rather than resolution). He praised Tehran for providing the group with arms and financial support, despite \\"differences between Iran and Hamas on issues connected with the conflict in Syria.\\" In this respect, however, he is walking a fine line with his regional backers in order to keep his regional options open. It is worth remembering that Hamas is not a monolithic entity. Some within the movement are more focused on resistance, while others are focused on governance, reconciling with Fatah and reining in independent Gaza-based militants. This is something I heard privately in January 2011 in Gaza and subsequently when talking to some of Hamas' senior political officials. The international community -- and Israel -- should work with the newly emerged regional troika of Egypt-Turkey-Qatar to engage with Hamas and strengthen Hamas's pragmatic wing. Given the strength of its ties, though, Iran could still prove to be a spoiling influence. This initiative, as specified by Clinton, should focus on steps toward \\"a just and lasting peace.\\" Let us hope that the past week or so has renewed the Obama administration's drive to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace. In the short term, this means pushing for Palestinian unity around a negotiating position and ending the blockade on Gaza, both of which the Qatari emir stressed in his landmark trip to Gaza last month. The continuation of this blockade helps no one, and the destitution it imposes on Gazans has only further radicalized much of the largely young population. About 80% of Gaza's households live on less than 2 a day, while 1.3 million or 80% of its citizens receive some form of food aid. No wonder the U.N. recently declared that under current circumstances, the strip would be unlivable by 2020, citing shortages of food, water electricity, jobs, hospital beds and classrooms. Opinion: Israel, engage Abbas now. If such conditions continue, Hamas may well resort to further rocket attacks against Israel's southern communities or turn a blind eye to other groups launching such terror attacks. Groups such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and the small but growing number of Salafi groups that have agreed to the cease-fire will pose a challenge to Hamas' authority, especially if there is no progress on the ground. These international efforts begin with the implementation of the admittedly shaky cease-fire. Egypt has emphasized the importance of effectively ending the blockade on Gaza -- one of the conditions of the cease-fire document. In the post-Cast Lead border arrangement, Israel retained significant veto powers over the passage of people and the flow of goods through Egypt's border crossings with Gaza. The new Egypt, however, has stressed the importance of formalizing the free flow of goods into and out of Gaza. In doing so, it wants to diminish the role of the \\"informal\\" tunnel economy, which, while generating large amounts of revenue for Hamas, has helped create an unstable situation in the Sinai badlands. If Israel now fails to deliver on its responsibilities regarding the conditions of the cease-fire, it risks not only a return to conflict but also losing the good will of Morsy.","output":"Critics have argued that the cease-fire between Hamas and Israel has only served as a temporary solution, pointing to the unchanged reality on the ground. The truce is seen as a small first step towards a more durable solution, with the involvement of Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar highlighting a shift in regional dynamics. The international isolation of Hamas is now over, due in part to Egypt exercising its influence in delivering the cease-fire. The absence of the Palestinian Authority in negotiations shows that engaging with Hamas on its own is a possibility in a post-revolution Middle East. Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy missed an opportunity to encourage Palestinian unity by not involving Abbas and Meshaal in the conflict resolution. Although Iran continues to play a crucial role in Hamas, the recent crisis revealed the limits of their influence, prompting Hamas to turn to regional Sunni allies in Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar. The international community is urged to work with Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar to engage Hamas and strengthen its pragmatic wing. Steps towards a \\"just and lasting peace\\" should prioritize achieving Palestinian unity and ending the blockade on Gaza. The continuation of the blockade further exacerbates the destitute conditions in Gaza, radicalizing the young population. If nothing changes, Hamas could resort to more rocket attacks against Israel or turn a blind eye to other groups engaging in terror attacks. In summary, the cease-fire between Hamas and Israel only provides a temporary solution to a deeply rooted conflict. Focusing on creating Palestinian unity, ending the blockade on Gaza, and working with regional powers such as Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar will be essential in seeking a long-lasting resolution for peace between the two sides."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: The Simple-Minded Murder Movie plot: The story takes place in 1930's SkÃ¥ne, Sweden, and focuses on Sven, who is hare-lipped and thus can't speak correctly. Most people consider him stupid, and call him an idiot. The film begins with Sven and a woman, who we later learn is called Anna, driving an old car across the landscape. The sun is setting, and in the sky Sven sees three angels. He and Anna hide in an old house, and while Anna makes herself comfortable, Sven throws a huge, bloodstained blade into a well. He lies down beside Anna and starts his inner monologue about how it all began. When Sven's mother died, he was \\"taken care of\\" by HÃ¶glund (Hans Alfredsson), an evil factory owner who is a member of the local Nazi party, and lives on a farm. Sven must work on HÃ¶glund's farm without pay, and sleep among cows in the stables, where he is tormented by a rat. Being very goodhearted, Sven cannot make himself drown the animal once he has caught it, because he simply can't take another life. Having read the Bible, a gift from his sister, Sven imagines he is visited by three angels from time to time, whom he speaks to in a clear voice, making it clear that this dialog takes place in his own mind. One day he mets the wheelchair-bound Anna (Maria Johansson), whom he falls in love with, and having been mistreated at HÃ¶glund's, Sven escapes to Anna's family, who gladly take him in. At Anna's house, Sven is finally treated as an adult. He is given a real bed, gets to work at their own farm, and is paid by Anna's father, Mr. Anderson (Per Myrberg), \\"in real money\\", as he points out when HÃ¶glund comes and wants to take Sven back to his farm. Although Andersson wins the argument, Sven faints from fear. Sven decides to buy himself a motorcycle, a real Indian. But HÃ¶glund, now out for revenge, pulls some strings and uses his contacts to ensure Sven can't get a driver's license. After a long media battle arranged by Anderson, Sven gets his license and starts riding his motorcycle around town. HÃ¶glund, however, does not surrender that easily. The...

Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.  - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.  - James Hamilton Bachman (born 24 February 1972) is an English comedian, actor and writer. He has written for and acted in many British television and radio programmes, including \\"That Mitchell and Webb Look\\", \\"Saxondale\\", \\"Bleak Expectations\\" and \\"Sorry, I've Got No Head\\". In 2014 he co-starred in the film .  - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation.  - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.  - That Mitchell and Webb Look is a British sketch comedy television show starring David Mitchell and Robert Webb. As well as Mitchell and Webb themselves, the writers include Jesse Armstrong, James Bachman, Sam Bain, Mark Evans, Olivia Colman, Joel Morris, John Finnemore, and others.

Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy.  - A situation comedy, or sitcom, is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode. Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch, and stand-up comedy where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience. Sitcoms originated in radio, but today are found mostly on television as one9 of its dominant narrative forms. This form can also include mockumentaries.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west.

If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil. The term \\"feed\\" comes from the way a straight man is wont to set up jokes and \\"feed\\" them to his partner.  - Cambridge is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam about north of London. At the United Kingdom Census 2011, its population was 123,867, including 24,488 students.  - Sam Bain (born 1971) is a British comedy writer, best known for the Channel 4 sitcom \\"Peep Show\\".

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - Channel Four Television Corporation (informally Channel Four) is a publicly owned media company headquartered in London, United Kingdom.

Great 3 day weekend! Now back to the grind!  What is the sentiment of this tweet?","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be interpreted as a combination of positive and neutral emotions. Let's break it down into parts to provide a more detailed analysis of the sentiment. 1. \\"Great 3 day weekend!\\" - Positive Sentiment This part of the tweet expresses the user's enjoyment and satisfaction with the extended weekend. The term \\"great\\" is an affirmative adjective, which denotes that the user experienced a good time over the weekend. A three-day weekend typically refers to having an additional day off from work or school, giving more time for relaxation, leisure, or personal activities. Therefore, this part of the tweet showcases the user's positive experience and appreciation of the extended weekend. 2. \\"Now back to the grind!\\" - Neutral Sentiment This part of the tweet suggests a return to routine responsibilities following the three-day break. The word \\"grind\\" is often used informally to describe everyday tasks, work, or school, which can be repetitive or require continuous effort. While not necessarily negative, this statement implies that the user acknowledges and accepts the need to return to their regular obligations, which might not be as enjoyable or relaxing as their weekend. Although this expression may not fully convey enthusiasm, it doesn't project negativity or reluctance either. Thus, this portion of the tweet can be interpreted as neutral in sentiment. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet is a balanced mix of positive emotion due to the enjoyment derived from the three-day weekend and a neutral acknowledgment of returning to the daily work or school routine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering What does Jordan need to do before this? A:","output":"Before Jordan embarks on the journey of asking Jan out, based on her fondness for his slick back hair, there are several key steps he must take to ensure the best possible outcome. While options (a), (b), and (c) are all valid factors, let's break this down further: 1. Self-reflection: Before even approaching Jan, Jordan must conduct a self-assessment, determining his qualities, genuine intentions, and feelings for her. This will lay the groundwork for effective communication and ascertain that he is making this decision for the right reasons. 2. Confidence building: Aligning with option (b), Jordan should ready himself by being confident. This entails looking within himself and understanding his self-worth, highlighting his strengths, and being attentive to his appearance (including maintaining that slick back hair). Portraying self-assuredness often leaves a positive impact on others. 3. Gathering information: Jordan should engage in friendly conversations with Jan or mutual friends to gather insights about her likes, dislikes, and interests. This will aid in customizing his approach when asking her out, ensuring that the interaction is tailored specifically for her. It also demonstrates a genuine interest in Jan as he wants to know about her preferences. 4. Planning the encounter: Option (c) is crucial for making a great first impression when Jordan eventually asks Jan on a date. Jordan must consider various factors when planning the date, such as the level of intimacy desired, the location, recreational activities, and the overall atmosphere. Successful planning would entail selecting a place that perfectly balances Jan's interests and preferences, as well as leaving room for engaging conversation. 5. Practicing the proposal: Jordan should rehearse his approach to asking Jan out. The practice will not only boost his confidence but also help him refine his delivery. Jordan must aim to be genuine and enthusiastic to draw a positive response. 6. Preparing for different outcomes: As option (a) suggests, Jordan must be emotionally prepared for various responses from Jan. Despite mustering self-confidence and planning, there is always a possibility of rejection. In such cases, it is essential to be respectful and maintain composure. Jordan should accept the outcome gracefully and remind himself that a rejection is not a reflection of his self-worth. 7. Timing: Finally, choosing the right moment to ask Jan out is essential. Discerning when Jan is relaxed and open to conversation will increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome. In conclusion, Jordan must execute several steps in preparation for asking Jan out. These steps encompass elements of self-reflection, confidence-building, gathering information, planning, practicing, preparing for different outcomes, and selecting the timing. By doing so, Jordan will maximize his chances of success while demonstrating genuine interest and respect towards Jan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I read this background article the other day: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  I am facing a new situation today: Two identical chemical compounds are both in beakers on top of burners in a laboratory. Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which beaker's particles are moving slower?","output":"To answer the question correctly, we should consider the information from the background article and apply it to the new situation. Step by step, our thought process should be: 1. The background article states that when the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. 2. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, which causes them to move faster. 3. In the new situation, there are two beakers with identical chemical compounds: Beaker A on a low-temperature burner and Beaker X on a high-temperature burner. 4. Based on the information from the background article, the particles in Beaker X, which is on the high-temperature burner, are moving faster due to their higher energy. 5. Since the particles in Beaker X are moving faster, this implies that the particles in Beaker A (on the low-temperature burner) are moving slower in comparison. So, to answer the question correctly: The particles in Beaker A are moving slower because it is on a low-temperature burner, resulting in lower energy and slower movement compared to Beaker X, which is on a high-temperature burner."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, we will do this: 16 (Science) - 11 (Mathematics) = 5 This means that Ireland is 5 ranks higher in Mathematics than in Science among the OECD countries.

Context: Normal practice when handling ancient artifacts is to move carefully and minimize any sudden movements. Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged. But that’s exactly what we—a group of museum curators and conservators—did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of “rattling cups” that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior. The kantharos’s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape—and its striking decoration—are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made. A Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: ΚΑΣΤΟΡΠΟΛΥΔΕΥΙΚΕΣ (“KASTORPOLYDEUIKES”). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus—known together as the Dioskouroi—and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for—or in hope of—safe passage at sea or a successful race. The gold decoration supports this idea: because each brother split his time between Mt. Olympus and Hades, they were often represented by stars, depicted here beneath the cup’s rim. Further, the wreath, garlands, and bucrania (skulls of... Question: Why was the kantharos dedicated to the twin sons of Zeus?

Context: Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra.

His centre-right Fidesz has polled 45%, with most of the votes counted. A centre-left opposition alliance is trailing with 25%, while the far-right Jobbik party is credited with 21%. The Hungarian left has never fully recovered from its heavy defeat in the 2010 ballot, in which Mr Orban swept to power with a two-thirds majority. Sunday's election has been mainly fought over the state of the economy, correspondents say. \\"No doubt we have won,\\" Mr Orban told supporters gathered in the capital, Budapest, late on Sunday evening. \\"This was not just any odd victory. We have scored such a comprehensive victory, the significance of which we cannot yet fully grasp tonight.\\" He said the election results showed that Hungarians wanted to stay in the European Union, but with a strong national government. \\"I'm going to work every day so that Hungary will be a wonderful place,\\" he declared. Fidesz is predicted to win around 135 of the 199 seats in parliament. It now also seems likely that Jobbik will become the second-largest party in parliament, the BBC's Nick Thorpe reports from Budapest. Although the Socialist-led opposition is in second place, the five parties making up the alliance plan to form their own factions after the elections, our correspondent says. Observers say Jobbik's adoption of a softer image has paid dividends, as a recent opinion poll found leader Gabor Vona to be the most popular opposition politician. Fidesz supporters say Mr Orban's victory is a tribute to his leadership powers. But opposition parties have accused the prime minister throughout their campaign of undermining Hungarian democracy. They have also accused Mr Orban of curtailing civil liberties and harming free speech. Fidesz has insisted that reform was needed to complete the work of eradicating the legacy of Communism from the country, and reduce the budget deficit to below the EU's required 3% of gross domestic product.

News article: John Edwards trial begins Monday with opening statements (Chuck Burton / Associated Press) GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Opening statements are set for today in the trial of former presidential candidate John Edwards, as federal prosecutors try to prove that more than 900,000 paid to Edwards by two wealthy benefactors during his run for the White House should have been reported as campaign contributions because the money flowed to his mistress to preserve Edwards' image as a \\"family first\\" candidate. Edwards' defense team is expected to argue that the payments were gifts from wealthy friends and the money was used for expenses unrelated to the 2008 campaign. The fact that Edwards paid his mistress, campaign videographer Rielle Hunter, and helped her through the birth of a child fathered by the candidate, does not mean Edwards had to declare the gifts as campaign contributions, his lawyers say. Edwardsâ lawyers contend that the government's case requires the jury to accept a novel interpretation of a campaign finance law that âhas never been the basis of criminal or even civil liability in the statute's history.ââ The defense also plans to call two former FEC commissioners to the stand, who are expected to testify that, under the law at the time the money was paid to Edwards, it was not clear that it had to be classified as a campaign contribution. Campaign finance experts have said that the violations at issue have been previously handled as civil penalties, resulting in fines and payback requirements for the offending candidates. âThis case is significant both legally and politically,ââ said Kenneth Gross, a Washington ethics lawyer. âThis is the first criminal case dealing with an excessive gift, particularly a gift not ever going to a campaign, and spent for purposes seemingly unrelated to a campaign.ââ Prosecutors contend that bills paid by two Edwards benefactors, Rachel âBunnyââ Mellon, a banking heiress from Virginia, and the late Fred Baron, a Texas lawyer, actually were campaign donations because they were intended to protect Edwards' candidacy, which would have been derailed had the public learned of the affair. âThe charges against John Edwards in this case flow from his knowing and willful violation of the federal campaign finance laws during his campaign for the Democratic Partyâs nomination for president,ââ prosecutors said in court filings. Justice Department prosecutors contend this is a straightforward case of broken campaign finance laws: âA federal candidate may only accept and receive a limited amount of money from any one individual during an election cycle, and he must truthfully report the money he accepts and receives,ââ the department said in a trial brief. The former senator from North Carolina has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts related to campaign finance violations. If convicted of all charges, Edwards faces up to 30 years in prison and 1.5 million in fines. Opening arguments are scheduled to begin Monday morning and the much-anticipated trial is expected to last at least six weeks. Critics of the prosecution, while noting that Edwards' conduct was reprehensible, argue that the government is going too far in trying to tie a candidate's personal life to complex campaign finance laws. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group that generally supports the Justice Department against politicians charged with corruption, took the unusual step of criticizing prosecutors for pursuing the case. The group contends that the payments were gifts, not campaign contributions, noting that the payments continued after Edwards ended his campaign. The group cited a 2002 Federal Election Commission decision in which six commissioners unanimously agreed that a loan made to a congressman to help defray the costs of his divorce was not a campaign contribution because the donor and the politician “had a preexisting personal relationship.” The same precedent should apply to Edwards, the group said, because the money came from friends. “Sen. Edwards’ conduct was despicable and deserves society’s condemnation, but that alone does not provide solid grounds for a criminal case,” the group said in a statement last year. The trial is starting about a year and a half after Edwards’ wife, Elizabeth, died of cancer. Edwards carried on the affair with Hunter while his wife was terminally ill. Edwards’ defense team has suggested that he did not know about the money from Mellon and Baron. “The government assumes that Mr. Edwards knew about the monies; the evidence will prove otherwise,’’ his attorneys said in a court filing. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about a trial of a man named John Edwards, who used to be a candidate to become the leader of the United States. The trial is about whether more than 900,000 given to him by two rich friends should have been reported as campaign contributions. This means that prosecutors, the people trying to prove he did something wrong, think that he should have told everyone about the money because it was used to help hide his secret girlfriend and make him look like a good \\"family first\\" person. John Edwards and his lawyers say the money was a gift from friends and not related to his campaign. They also say that even if he used the money to pay his secret girlfriend and a baby he had with her, it doesn't mean he had to report it as campaign money. This is the first case like this ever, and some people think it's important because it could change how other similar cases are treated in the future. If John Edwards is found guilty, he could be in prison for up to 30 years and might have to pay as much as 1.5 million. The trial is expected to last at least six weeks.

Article: Powell boys suffered 'chop injuries' to neck and head      GRAHAM, Wash. -- Gallons of gasoline spread throughout the home of Josh Powell caused the inferno that destroyed his home Sunday, authorities said Monday evening, but his two young sons, Charlie and Braden, also suffered from what investigators described as \\"chop injuries\\" to their heads or necks.      Autopsies on the three bodies were completed late Monday, confirming that the boys died as a result of homicide, and Josh Powell died as a result of suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning.      The Pierce County Medical Examiner confirmed Charlie Powell, 5, died of carbon monoxide poisoning, but a chop injury to his neck was a contributing factor. Braden Powell, 7, died in the same manner, but sufferred a chop injury to the neck and head.      Investigators recovered a hatchet that they believe was used on the boys.      Detectives called the explosion a \\"deliberate, planned event\\" in which two five-gallon cans of gasoline were used as an accelerant to blast the home apart; gas from one can was spread around the house, and the other can was apparently ignited in the center of the house, where the bodies of Josh, Charlie and Braden were found.      The house burst into flames after a social worker brought the boys there for a supervised visit. Powell blocked the social worker from entering the house.      Investigation shifts to Josh Powell's father      The Sunday blaze at Powell's home brought yet another twist in the very public scandal and investigation that began when Josh's wife, Susan Powell, vanished from the family's Utah home in 2009.      The investigation now shifts to Josh's father, Steven Powell, who is currently jailed on voyerism and child pornography charges and has refused to be interviewed since the explosion. Last fall, detectives found images and video of neighborhood girls, as well as Susan Powell, in his possession. Steven has been named a person of interest in her disappearance.      Susan's parents believe Steven Powell holds the key to finding out what really happened to their daughter.            \\"I think he is the only one who would know. I think Josh would have confided in him enough to know where she might be,\\" said Chuck Cox. \\"He's not going to tell us anything.\\"            \\"It's up to the police,\\" said Judy Cox.      Steven Powell claimed he and Susan had a romantic relationship, but detectives said Monday those statements are \\"a flat out lie,\\" and that Susan viewed her father-in-law as a \\"creep, and weird.\\"      Steven Powell has been put on suicide watch. Investigators have not said when they planned to speak to him.      Emails from Josh Powell found      Multiple emails from Josh Powell have since been found in close family members' in-boxes, including his cousins, and his pastor. Details of those emails have not been made explicitly clear, except that they included goodbyes and how to take care of any final business.      INTERACTIVE: Review the entire Powell case from the beginning      All of the emails were sent minutes before the social worker showed up at Powell's home with his sons Sunday afternoon for a court-ordered visitation.      Detectives said more evidence has emerged about Josh Powell's actions leading up to Sunday's blast, such as taking the boys' toys and books to Goodwill.      The deaths of Powell and the two boys brings an end to a case that started in December, 2009, when Josh's wife Susan went missing in the Utah desert. Her body has still not been found.      Attorneys for Susan's parents have said recently the boys had begun to talk about what happened the night their mother went missing, saying, \\"Mommy was in the trunk.\\" Josh maintained he and the boys went camping the night Susan disappeared, around 12:30 a.m.      However, detectives said Monday despite all of the evidence found so far at the scene, none of it has had anything to do with the disappearance of Susan. ||||| Susan Powell's Dad: Our Worst Fears Came True      Chuck Cox says that the family told anybody who would listen: It was only a matter of time before his son-in-law Josh Powell killed himself and his two boys.On Sunday, those worst fears were realized when Josh, long a person of interest in the disappearance of wife Susan Powell, blew up his Tacoma, Wash.-area house in what is being characterized as a double-murder suicide.\\"We stated our fear many times, that if he was feeling desperate, that he would possibly kill himself and the boys, that this kind of thing could happen,\\" Susan's father Chuck tells PEOPLE. \\"If he felt there was no way out, that he wouldn't let anyone else have them. They were possessions to him.\\"As Josh tangled with Susan's relatives over the boys, Charlie, 7, and Branden, 5, Cox says he relayed his concerns to his attorney, to the court, to the county sheriff, to family services officials.\\"They were all aware of our fears – that he would take a cowardly way out,\\" says Cox.Powell, who had denied wrongdoing in his wife's disappearance, had been fighting to regain custody of their boys, who were being cared for by their maternal grandparents.A judge had recently ordered Powell, whose father is the subject of a child pornography case , to undergo a psychosexual evaluation, according to reports. ||||| Originally published February 6, 2012 at 1:56 PM | Page modified February 7, 2012 at 8:56 PM      Charlie and Braden Powell's grandparents said Monday the boys hadn't wanted to go visit their father, and described an ominous drawing the younger boy had made.      Powell's voicemail: 'I am not able to go on'      Commenting has been disabled because of the sensitive nature of this story.      Josh Powell's final, horrific act — killing his sons and himself in a fiery inferno — was tantamount to a confession to his wife's disappearance and presumed death, according to the Pierce County prosecuting attorney.      \\"If there was any doubt about who murdered Susan Powell, it's gone now,\\" Mark Lindquist said.      On Sunday, when Powell attacked his two sons with a hatchet and then set fire to his Graham rental home, he had long been considered by Utah police to be a person of interest in his wife's December 2009 disappearance. But charges had never been brought against him despite questions over his claims that his wife went missing after he took his two sons camping in the middle of the night in freezing temperatures.      Despite Powell's death, police in West Valley City, Utah, say the investigation into Susan Powell's disappearance will continue.      Lindquist's reference to Susan Powell's presumed slaying isn't the first time authorities indicated they believe the missing mother of two was the victim of homicide. A search warrant obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request Tuesday shows that police in Utah were investigating three felonies in connection with the case: first-degree murder, kidnapping and obstructing a public servant.      Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill acknowledged for the first time that they believe Powell is likely dead, but said the case remains a missing persons probe for now.      Gill wouldn't discuss the evidence, but said authorities don't have enough information to file charges in the case.      \\"I think when I talk about it as a missing persons case, that's because we haven't located the body of Susan Powell,\\" Gill said in an interview with the AP. \\"Do we think that she may have met harm? Sure.\\"      Investigators are now reassessing the case after her husband, Josh Powell, killed their sons Charlie, 7, and Braden, 5, during a court-ordered visit Sunday at his Graham home. The boys' grandparents, Chuck and Judy Cox, say the boys were reluctant to go on the visit.      But the visits were court-ordered after Josh Powell lost custody of the boys in the fall, and the Coxes insisted they go.      \\"They liked seeing their dad,\\" Chuck Cox said. \\"But the last time they didn't want to go.\\"      It was during Sunday's visit that the sheriff's office says Josh Powell set fire to the rental home in Graham, killing both boys and himself moments after a state-contracted caseworker brought them for the supervised visitation.      Sheriff's officials said Monday they believed Josh Powell had planned the deadly fire for some time. They said he dropped off toys and books at Goodwill over the weekend and sent final emails to friends and acquaintances shortly before the blaze.      Detectives found evidence of 10 gallons of gasoline inside the home, said sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Ed Troyer. Gasoline from a 5-gallon can was spread throughout the house and used as an accelerant for the huge blaze. Another 5-gallon can was found near the bodies, he said      Troyer called the deadly fire \\"a deliberate, planned-out event.\\"      Chillingly, Powell may have first incapacitated his sons by attacking them with a hatchet.      The Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office on Monday said all three died from smoke inhalation. But both boys also suffered \\"chop injuries,\\" Braden to his head and neck, and Charlie to his neck.      Troyer said a hatchet was recovered near the bodies.      \\"Just when you thought it couldn't get any grimmer, you learn he had assaulted his kids with an ax,\\" Lindquist said.      In the emails sent before the fire, Powell wrote his lawyer, pastor, friends and relatives, telling some, \\"I'm sorry. I can't live without my boys.\\" He also left instructions on how to take care of his \\"final business,\\" according to Troyer.      He said none of the emails mentioned Powell's wife and the mother of the boys, Susan Powell, 28, who has been missing since December 2009. Powell had long been considered a person of interest in her disappearance from their home in West Valley City, Utah.      On Monday, a tearful Chuck and Judy Cox spoke of their family's pain over the boys' deaths, compounded by the disappearance of their daughter.      Powell, 36, told police he last saw Susan around midnight Dec. 7, 2009, when he put their sons in a minivan and took them on a late-night camping trip in Utah's west desert in freezing temperatures.      But police, almost from the start, questioned Powell's story. Powell later moved back to the Puyallup area, where both his father and Susan Powell's parents live.      The Coxes on Monday also spoke about a drawing Braden had made showing the family of three riding in their minivan. Braden said the drawing was of the two boys and their father.      When asked why their mother wasn't in the drawing, Braden said she was in the trunk, Chuck Cox said.      Cox recalled that the boy said, \\"Mommy and Daddy got out but Mommy didn't come back.\\"      At the time of their mother's disappearance, Braden was 2 and Charles was 4.      Anne Bremner, an attorney for the Coxes, said as recently as Christmas the boys told their grandparents \\"mommy's in the mine.\\" Police in Utah had searched abandoned mine shafts in Nevada last summer, but found no sign of Susan Powell.      The Coxes said the drawing of the minivan was given to police in West Valley City, who are investigating the disappearance of Susan Powell.      Buzz Nielsen, chief of the West Valley Police Department, declined to comment Monday on the drawing or any other specific evidence in the Susan Powell case.      Nielsen, who flew to Washington on Monday, said that investigators have been working on building a case against Powell with \\"strong circumstantial evidence.\\" He said he had hoped to see charges filed later this year.      Nielsen said Powell was not aware of the progress of the investigation. He speculated that Powell's decision to take his life and kill his children was not sparked by fear of arrest.      He said Powell's death will not stop investigators from trying to piece together what happened to Susan Powell.      Nielsen said his detectives will try to speak with Josh's father, Steven Powell, whose arrest last September on child-pornography and voyeurism charges prompted the state to take custody of Charlie and Braden. The boys and their father had lived with Steven Powell, who remains in custody in Pierce County Jail.      He described Steve Powell as another \\"person of interest,\\" but noted the elder Powell is \\"not in our sights\\" in terms of any potentially imminent arrest.      About noon Sunday, a state contract worker from Foster Care Resource Network brought the boys for a scheduled visit to Powell's Graham house. The caseworker was assigned to the children and had previously brought them to their father without incident, Troyer said.      Powell answered the door, pulled the boys inside, slammed the door and locked it, Troyer said. Denied entry, the caseworker immediately began banging on the home's doors and windows and called 911. She told police she thought she smelled gasoline.      The caseworker reported the fire started within seconds, Troyer said.      On Monday, the Coxes took reporters into an addition they had built on their Puyallup home to make room for their grandchildren. The room had two small beds with handmade quilts, one decorated with characters from the movie \\"Cars\\" and the other with Spider-Man. Toys were stacked in a nearby room.      They talked about how the boys had been emotionally distant when they arrived in September.      They'd been shunned by other children, Chuck Cox said, because people disliked or mistrusted their father.      \\"They said that in their old school, the other kids walked 10 feet in front of them or 10 behind them,\\" he said.      When they talked about their mother initially, they called her \\"Susan,\\" Cox said.      But Cox said he knew they were making progress when Charlie pointed to a smiling picture of his mother in the living room and asked his grandpa to take a picture of him next to the photo.      \\"He said, 'I'm sitting with my mommy.' \\"      Christine Clarridge: 206-464-8983 or cclarridge@seattletimes.com      Seattle Times staff reporters Jennifer Sullivan, Katherine Long and Steve Miletich contributed to this report, which includes information from The Associated Press. |||||Summary:","output":"A very sad thing happened where a man named Josh Powell hurt his two young sons, Charlie and Braden, with a tool called a hatchet and then caused a big fire in their home.

Before this happened, Josh's wife, Susan, went missing a long time ago, and nobody knows what happened to her.

For a sentence to be considered linguistically acceptable, it must adhere to the rules of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics applicable to the language in question. In the case of the given sentence, there are several issues that make it unacceptable: 1. Lack of Coordination or Punctuation: There is an absence of conjunction like \\"and\\" to link the two phrases \\"some flowers\\" and \\"some bread.\\" Additionally, there is no punctuation to separate the two phrases adequately. 2. Ambiguity: The sentence has an ambiguous meaning due to the lack of coordination or punctuation, which makes it difficult to derive any coherent meaning from it. 3. Syntax: The sentence is syntactically incorrect because of the absence of proper conjunctions or punctuation, resulting in ambiguous phrases that do not form a coherent clause. 4. Semantics: The sentence is semantically flawed since the intended meaning is unclear due to the lack of proper grammatical structures and ambiguous phrasing. To make the sentence linguistically acceptable, a proper conjunction or punctuation must be applied to clarify its meaning and adhere to the rules of grammar and syntax. Here are a few examples of corrected sentences: 1. \\"Mary should buy some flowers and some bread.\\" In this version, the conjunction \\"and\\" is used to link the two phrases, addressing the issues of coordination, ambiguity, and syntax while conveying a clear meaning. 2. \\"Mary should buy some flowers; some bread.\\" Using a semicolon provides an appropriate punctuation to separate the two phrases and effectively conveys that these are two separate yet related items Mary needs to purchase. 3. \\"Mary should buy some flowers. She should also buy some bread.\\" By separating the ideas into two sentences, we can maintain coherence and clarity while effectively communicating the intended meaning. In summary, the original sentence is not linguistically acceptable due to issues with coordination, ambiguity, syntax, and semantics. By introducing a proper conjunction or punctuation, we can correct these issues and create a clear, coherent, and linguistically acceptable sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which reservior would most likely have excellent water quality, reservoir A or reservoir B?  There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B.  Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. A:","output":"Reservoir A would most likely have excellent water quality. The paragraph provides a number of clues to support this conclusion. Firstly, reservoir A has an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoir, while reservoir B does not. This means that reservoir A receives proper care and oversight to ensure its water quality, while reservoir B is left without proper regulation. The hint provided also indicates that water levels are lowered in the fall to prevent damage from ice and maintain excellent water quality. Since the engineer for reservoir A carries out this process, it can be inferred that reservoir A benefits from this seasonal regulation, leading to better water quality. On the other hand, reservoir B has not had its water level regulated in the fall due to the lack of an engineer, which suggests that it's at higher risk of ice damage, as well as potentially having worse water quality as a significant portion of the water is not being replaced.  In conclusion, based on the presence of an engineer for reservoir A and the resulting regulation of water levels, as well as the paragraph's indication that this process leads to excellent water quality, reservoir A would most likely have better water quality than reservoir B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Every dish we ordered was beautifully plated, colorful, and bursting with flavors. We started with the crispy zucchini blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese, which had a perfect balance between the delicate, tender zucchini and the flavorful, slightly tangy ricotta cheese. For the main course, I opted for the pan-seared Chilean sea bass, served on a bed of sautéed kale and wild mushroom risotto. The fish was cooked to perfection – flaky, moist, and infused with a delightful, subtle citrus flair. My friends were equally impressed with their dishes: a delightful Thai green curry and a scrumptious truffle oil-infused mushroom pasta. Despite being satiated from our meal, we couldn't resist trying their impressive dessert selection. We shared the deconstructed tiramisu and the passion fruit cheesecake. Not only were they visually stunning, but they tasted divine, providing a wonderful end to an incredible meal. In addition to the exquisite food and top-notch service, The Garden Bistro also impressed us with their excellent attention to hygiene and current health guidelines. The staff frequently sanitized surfaces, politely reminded guests to wear masks when necessary, and ensured that social distancing was maintained.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.  The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.  Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\"  Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.

In some cases, it could be the individual themselves who wishes to impose a level of control or restraint, while in other situations it could be an authority figure or a social norm that dictates the need for a more disciplined and moderate approach. A self-denying punishment demands a considerable amount of self-control and restraint, as it often involves giving up on desires that provide immediate gratification. This can be seen as a difficult and constant struggle, but it can also lead to a greater sense of self-awareness, self-discipline, and appreciation for a balanced lifestyle. Self-denial can also help individuals avoid the negative consequences of over-indulgence, which can include addiction, financial strain, health problems, or damaged relationships. While the other options – severe, harsh, hard, and strict – might suggest an imposition of punishment from an external source or authority, they may not necessarily provide the best guidance for an individual who continually engages in over-indulgent behavior. Punishments that are perceived as too severe or harsh could potentially lead to resentment or resistance, further fueling the cycle of indulgence. In contrast, choosing the act of self-denial as a way to reevaluate and modify one's behavior may bring about lasting change, and help individuals develop healthier habits and coping mechanisms. When a person takes responsibility for their own actions, they are more likely to feel a sense of ownership and agency in their transformation. Additionally, self-denial allows room for growth and learning, as it encourages reflection, introspection, and mindfulness, which can guide individuals towards a more balanced and fulfilling life. In conclusion, for someone who is over-indulgent, a punishment characterized by self-denial is the most suitable method to address and change their behavior, as it fosters self-awareness, self-discipline, and personal growth. Although it requires a significant amount of willpower and introspection, self-denial can lead to many positive transformations and a healthier, more balanced lifestyle. While other forms of punishment may be perceived as too severe or not effective, a self-denying approach encourages personal responsibility, introspection, and mindfulness, allowing for deeper understanding of one's choices and habits, and consequently, leading to lasting change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: In Vietnam, Tet-Trung-Thu, or the Mid-Autumn Festival, is one of the most popular family holidays. It is held on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month. Vietnamese families plan their activities around their children on this special day. In a Vietnamese folk story, parents were working so hard to prepare for the harvest that they left the children playing by themselves. To make up for that time, the parents would use the Mid-Autumn Festival as a chance to show their love and thanks for their children. As a result, the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Children's Festival. In the United States, this tradition continues in many Vietnamese-American families. Activities are often centered on children and education. Parents buy lanterns for their children so that they can take part in a candle and lantern parade at dawn. Lanterns mean brightness, while the parade means success in school. Vietnamese markets sell a variety of lanterns, but the most popular children's lantern is the star lantern. Other children's activities include arts and crafts in which children make face masks and lanterns. Children also perform traditional Vietnamese dances for adults and take part in contests for prizes. Unicorn   dancers are also very popular. Like Chinese people, Vietnamese parents tell their children folk stories and serve moon cakes and other special treats under the bright moon. A favorite folk story is about a carp   that wanted to become a dragon. The carp worked and worked and finally changed itself into a dragon. Parents use this story to encourage their children to work hard so that they can become whatever they want to be. Question: The parents tell their children folk stories because   _  .

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore.  Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size.  \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\"  While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.  India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores.  The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added.  For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\"  The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Presidential rivals trade charges of lying, Romney calls for apology over 'felony' remark The battle between President Obama and Mitt Romney reached new levels of rancor Thursday, with each campaign accusing the other of lying over Romney's tenure at private-equity firm Bain Capital. The charges flew at a rapid pace, and by the end of the day the Romney campaign was calling for an apology after a senior Obama campaign official said the Republican presidential candidate may have committed a felony. Obama official Stephanie Cutter made the claim following a Boston Globe article that said documents show Romney was in charge at Bain for three years longer than he had claimed. Cutter said Romney was either misrepresenting his position at Bain to the Securities and Exchange Commission, \\"which is a felony,\\" or misrepresenting to the American people. Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades issued a blistering statement in response. \\"President Obama's campaign hit a new low today when one of its senior advisers made a reckless and unsubstantiated charge to reporters about Mitt Romney that was so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign,\\" Rhoades said. \\"President Obama ought to apologize for the out-of-control behavior of his staff, which demeans the office he holds. Campaigns are supposed to be hard fought, but statements like those made by Stephanie Cutter belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works.\\" The challenge capped a frenzied and nasty day on the campaign trail. Earlier, Romney released a new ad calling Obama dishonest and asking if the American people can \\"trust him to lead\\" if he \\"doesn't tell the truth.\\" The release which accompanied the ad in an email to reporters also cited Obama's \\"lies and exaggerations.\\" The ad titled, \\"No Evidence,\\" was an aggressive rebuttal to Obama's claims that Romney outsourced jobs while at the helm of Bain Capital. \\"There was no evidence that Mitt Romney shipped jobs overseas,\\" a narrator says in the ad. But the Obama campaign pushed back in a statement charging the ad is part of Romney's \\"big Bain lie.\\" Relying on the report in the Globe claiming government documents reveal Romney remained CEO of Bain for three years longer than he claimed, the Obama camp statement went on to say the ad is \\"based on a false premise.\\" In a filing with the SEC in February 2001, Bain Capital listed Romney as the company's \\"sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.\\" It said Romney's \\"principal occupation\\" was as Bain's managing director. Romney's campaign repeatedly has said Romney had virtually nothing to do with the company's operations after February 1999, when he began work on the troubled 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Questions about Romney's control at Bain from 1999 to 2001 are important in his bid to oust Obama this fall. That's when the company oversaw investments that either created jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy. It's also a time during which Romney stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in Bain Capital. Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign manager, said Romney may have committed a felony if he misrepresented his role at Bain on the SEC documents. And if he was running Bain after 1999, Cutter said, Romney hasn't been truthful with the public. \\"If that's the case, if he was lying to the American people, then that's a real character and trust issue,\\" she said. But Romney's campaign issued a statement Thursday from Bain that said Romney \\"left Bain Capital in February 1999 to run the Olympics and has had absolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities of the firm or with any of its portfolio companies since the day of his departure. Due to the sudden nature of Mr. Romney's departure, he remained the sole stockholder for a time while formal ownership was being documented and transferred to the group of partners who took over management of the firm in 1999. Accordingly, Mr. Romney was reported in various capacities on SEC filings during this period.\\" J.W. Verrett, an attorney and assistant professor in economics, also told Fox News that the original Globe report appeared to \\"be confused\\" about the SEC filings. He noted they refer to \\"Bain Capital VI,\\" which he described as an investment separate from Bain Capital itself. \\"Saying that Governor Romney was the CEO of Bain Capital VI is like saying that I am the CEO of my retirement account ... it's a silly bit of legalese and it doesn't also mean I am CEO of all the companies in which I invest,\\" he said in an email. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Summary:","output":"In the 2012 presidential campaign between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, accusations flew between both parties as they disputed Romney's tenure at private-equity firm Bain Capital. The debate escalated after a Boston Globe article claimed Romney was in charge of Bain for three years longer than he stated. As a result, Obama campaign official Stephanie Cutter suggested Romney may have misrepresented his position to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would be a felony. Romney's campaign swiftly responded, calling for an apology and questioning the integrity of Obama's campaign. Alongside this, Romney released an ad titled \\"No Evidence,\\" debunking Obama's claim that Romney outsourced jobs while at Bain. The controversy surrounding Romney's control at Bain between 1999 and 2001 became increasingly important during the campaign due to Bain's management of investment activities during that period."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Your job is to evaluate the truthfulness of these statements. 2. Evaluating the Guidelines: The guidelines provide ten different types of statements you may receive.

(AP) – Jack Garcia was a challenging kid — smart, but stubborn and uncommunicative, especially in his early years, according to those who knew him. But by third grade, before his mother moved him across the country to live with a man she'd met online, \\"he was ready to soar,\\" said Margaret Saleh, assistant superintendent of pupil services in the Goleta, California, school system. Once in Maryland, though, the 9-year-old's life changed dramatically — and ended brutally. His mother, Oriana Garcia, didn't enroll him in public schools and considered home-schooling instead. Rather than seeking professional help for Jack's behavioral problems as she'd done in California, police say his mother, Oriana Garcia, allowed her boyfriend, Robert \\"Roy\\" Wilson, and her brother Jacob Barajas to physically discipline the red-haired boy. During the four months they all lived together in Wilson's three-bedroom Hagerstown apartment, the 30-year-old warehouse worker's methods escalated from slapping and sparring to smacking his legs with a bamboo sword, Barajas told police. Then came the handcuffs, with Oriana Garcia's knowledge, \\"to teach Jack not to steal,\\" she told investigators. The abuse culminated June 30 while Garcia worked as a retail store supervisor, according to court records. Barajas handcuffed the boy, and Wilson knocked him down with blows so severe that Jack begged him to stop. Barajas told police it got so bad that he removed the handcuffs, but Wilson continued, repeatedly hitting the boy in the stomach until he passed out. Jack's crime: he was suspected of taking some birthday cake belonging to Wilson's 2-year-old daughter. Police say Garcia planned and participated in some of the discipline, such as making Jack eat until he felt sick and forcing him to exercise. That evening, as Jack lay critically injured, handcuffed and bound to a chair, police say she delayed his care for hours by sending away an ambulance Barajas had called. Only when the boy's breathing turned to alarming gurgles did Wilson make a second 911 call — but it was too late. Jack died five days later. On Wednesday, a judge ordered Garcia and Barajas held without bail on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree child abuse. Their public defender declined comment. Wilson, arrested before Jack's death, is being held is being held on assault and child-abuse charges with bail set at 1 million. He faces the possibility of more charges after a grand jury hearing as early as next week. His public defender has also declined comment, and his brother declined comment when reached by phone Wednesday. Jack's death stunned Daniel Fletcher, a 35-year-old market researcher now living in Orem, Utah, who lived with Garcia for five years in Arizona and California. When they were together, he said, Garcia favored time-outs over corporal punishment because she had read that physical punishment can make a child more aggressive. He said they broke up at her insistence but were still living together in a rented room when she met Wilson online. Garcia had never seen Wilson in person before she pulled Jack out of school and boarded a train in February bound for Hagerstown, a city of 40,000 in the Appalachian foothills about 70 miles west of Baltimore. She was a single mother in a difficult situation, living with a man she no longer loved; otherwise, Fletcher said he doesn't know what motivated her. She transferred to another Ross discount clothing store in the Hagerstown area and brought her brother along to watch Jack while she and Wilson worked. Fletcher, who was working then at a Goleta Kmart, said he would have taken Garcia back, but her mind was made up. She pulled Jack out of school and headed east. He last saw Jack on a Skype conversation a few days before the deadly beating. \\"I cared about her and I cared about Jack,\\" said Fletcher, who traveled to Maryland for the boy's funeral over the weekend. \\"They were my people. They're still my people.\\" Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This is a sad story about a 9-year-old boy named Jack.

Answer the following question: Aubrey came to Lee, distraught as Lee had just lost the game, and hugged them for support.  Given the context: How would Lee feel afterwards? Answer:","output":"Given the context, Lee may likely feel comforted and supported after Aubrey's hug. This is because physical expressions such as hugging are often associated with empathy, care, and support.  The justification for this is driven by the information provided in the scenario: 1. Lee had just lost a game, which could indicate that they might be feeling disappointed, frustrated, or sad. 2. Aubrey, recognizing Lee's distress, chooses to hug Lee. This act of consoling, given willingly, signifies Aubrey's intention to provide emotional comfort. 3. Aubrey's action implies that she cares about Lee's feelings, which, in turn, might uplift Lee's spirits to some extent. So, considering these factors and the emotional significance that a consoling hug usually has, one can infer that Lee would probably feel a bit better--more supported and comforted--after the interaction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\" Sangria, rather like punch, is a popular thirst-quenching refresher, especially in summer.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Sangria is suited for hot environments.\\" true?  + yes  + it is not possible to tell  + no","output":"Yes, the hypothesis \\"Sangria is suited for hot environments\\" can be considered true based on the given premise. The statement clearly states that Sangria, much like punch, serves as a popular thirst-quenching refresher, especially during summer. Summer is characterized by hot weather, and refreshers are beverages typically consumed to help people cool down and stay hydrated in high temperature environments. Sangria is originally from Spain, a country known for its hot and sunny Mediterranean climate. The ingredients that make up a classic Sangria include various fruits, red wine (although white wine can also be used), sweeteners such as sugar, a small amount of brandy or another type of alcohol, and some soda water or lemonade to make it fizzy. These ingredients complement each other to create a delicious and refreshing beverage that can help alleviate the effects of heat. The fruit pieces in Sangria not only provide taste but also add to its refreshing nature. Fruits, such as oranges, apples, lemons, and berries, are known for their hydration properties and high water content, making them perfect for hot environments. Additionally, the combination of these fruits with wine, alcohol, and fizz creates a dynamic blend of flavors that is both enjoyable and thirst-quenching. In hot environments, people tend to feel more thirsty and may lose fluids through sweating. A drink like Sangria serves the purpose of replenishing those lost fluids while providing a refreshing and flavorsome experience. It is important to note, however, that Sangria should be consumed in moderation, as it still contains alcohol, which can lead to dehydration if consumed excessively. Moreover, Sangria's popularity as a summer beverage has been well-documented across various cultures and countries that experience hot climates. It is a common sight at summertime gatherings and celebrations, where it is appreciated for its refreshing qualities. In conclusion, based on the premise that Sangria is a popular thirst-quenching refresher, especially in summer, it can be said that the hypothesis \\"Sangria is suited for hot environments\\" is true. The combination of fruits, wine, alcohol, and fizz, along with its hydrating properties, make Sangria a perfect choice for a refreshing drink in high-temperature settings. However, it is crucial to consume Sangria responsibly to avoid the potential negative effects of excess alcohol consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Supervixens Movie plot: Gas station attendant Clint Ramsey, who works at Martin Bormann's Super Service in the desert, finds himself too irresistible to a series of girls, all of whom have the word \\"Super\\" in their given names. In the beginning, he is married to the hypersexual, demanding, and jealous SuperAngel (Shari Eubank), who constantly harasses him at work. She orders him home at once when she calls Clint and overhears a female customer, SuperLorna (Christy Hartburg), hitting on him at work. Clint finds SuperAngel's constant accusations and arguing a turnoff and, back at home, they fight after he rejects her aggressive advances. A neighbor calls the police as Clint leaves for a local bar, where the bartender is the very scantily clad SuperHaji (Haji). Meanwhile, SuperAngel seduces Harry Sledge (Charles Napier), the cop who responded to the police call. He is impotent and unable to perform. She repeatedly taunts and insults him over this, which finally results in him killing her by stomping her brutally in a bathtub, then throwing a radio in the water which was plugged into the wall socket. Sledge burns down the house, then tries to pin the murder on Clint. Clint claims being in the pub all night, but SuperHaji has her revenge on him (from insulting her breast size earlier) by refusing to confirm his alibi. Clint is then forced to flee. In his rush to escape, Clint hitchhikes a ride from a boy (John LaZar) and his girlfriend SuperCherry (Colleen Brennan). During the drive, SuperCherry comes on to him and puts his hand over her breast, but then pulls it back. She then tries to give him a handjob over his pants, but he continues to resist her advances. The driver takes offense to Clint rejecting his girlfriend, but she says he probably just wants a closer contact. She again attempts and fails to seduce him and he asks the driver to let him get out.

This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai.  The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu.

He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops.

Israel does not have a constitution, but the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: \\"The State of Israel (...) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.\\" Israeli law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages, and provides for class action suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women. In 2012, Israel ranked eleventh out of 59 developed nations for participation of women in the workplace. Since the founding of the State of Israel, relatively few women have served in the Israeli government, and fewer still have served in the leading ministerial offices. While Israel is one of a small number of countries where a woman--Golda Meir--has served as Prime Minister, it is behind most Western countries in the representation of women in both the parliament and government.  Although the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: \\"The State of Israel (...) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex,\\" the Haredi political parties (Shas and United Torah Judaism) have never allowed women on their lists for Knesset elections. However, in December 2014, women activists in the Haredi community have threatened a boycott of Haredi parties in upcoming elections if women are not included in election slates.  As of 2016, women comprised 26.7% of Israel's 120-member Knesset, placing it 54th of 185 countries in which women are included in the legislature. For comparison, the female ratio in Scandinavia is over 40%, the European Union average is 17.6%, while in the Arab world it is 6.4%. Female representation varies significantly by demographics: most female politicians have represented secular parties, while very few have come from religious Jewish or Arab parties.  In January 1986 Israeli female teacher Leah Shakdiel was granted membership in the religious council of Yeruham, but the Minister of Religious Affairs Zvulun Hammer canceled her membership on the grounds that women should not serve in that capacity. In early 1987 a petition was submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court regarding this incident. The Supreme Court precedent-setting ruling was unanimously accepted in Shakdiel's favor, and in 1988 Shakdiel became the first woman in Israel to serve in a religious council.

Movie title: Mirrors 2 Movie plot: Max Matheson (Nick Stahl) was involved in a car accident over a year ago that kills his fiancÃ©e, Kayla (Jennifer Sipes). Due to the accident, he becomes emotionally disturbed and undergoes psychological treatment with Dr. Beaumont (Ann Mckenzie), making some progress in dealing with the guilt over the accident. To help Max move forward, his father, Jack Matheson (William Katt), reopens the Mayflower Department Store in New Orleans and invites Max to replace the security guard, who recently quit under mysterious circumstances while apparently \\"cutting himself up\\" on duty. Max accepts the job and his father introduces him to the store manager, Keller Landreaux (Lawrence Turner), the buyer, Jenna McCarty (Christy Carlson Romano), and the vice-president of operations, Ryan Parker (Jon Michael Davis). Before his first shift, Max sees a vision of a dead woman in a mirror, and then sees Jenna's reflection, ripping off her head. Meanwhile, Jenna is killed by her reflection, being thrown through glass doors and a shard of glass decapitating her. Max realizes that he foresees the deaths in the mirrors. That night, he tries to find the ghost, but instead sees Ryan's reflection being eviscerated. He tries to contact Ryan, but gets no response. Later, Ryan is killed, in the same way as his reflection. Max sees his father's face covered in cuts in a puddle then races to his father's house. Jack is almost killed by his reflection, after Max made it to his house and hints to whoever is manipulating the mirrors that he would do whatever she wants him to do if she spares his father. Max later returns to the Mayflower, but he is stopped by Detectives Huston and Piccirilli (Lance E. Nichols, Wayne PÃ©re), explaining what happened in Ryan and Jenna's deaths. Max denies any involvement and, though they remain suspicious, they let Max get back to his work. Max goes to the main mirror, to find out who the ghost is. Suddenly, Max's reflection shows a light, which Max follows in each of the mirrors. He finds a box and opens it to... Answer:","output":"Max finds the ID of a young woman named Eleanor Reigns (Stephanie Honoré) in the box. Eleanor was a former employee at the Mayflower Department Store who went missing under mysterious circumstances. Max becomes determined to uncover the truth behind Eleanor's disappearance and the connection to the horrific mirror-related deaths at the store.  As Max delves deeper into the mystery, he learns that Eleanor was not just an employee but also had a romantic relationship with Ryan Parker, the store's vice-president of operations. However, their relationship took a dark turn when Eleanor accused Ryan of sexual assault, but for unknown reasons, her claims were never pursued, and Ryan continued to work at the store. As a result, Eleanor tried to warn others about Ryan's actions, leading her to become a target for the store's management. With the help of Dr. Beaumont and some research, Max starts to piece together that the Mayflower Department Store was built on the site of an old sanitarium, which adds to the supernatural elements surrounding the mirrors in the store. It is also revealed that Ryan, Keller, and Jenna were involved in a cover-up surrounding Eleanor's disappearance and alleged death after Ryan murdered her to keep her quiet about his abuse. In the course of the film, the ghost of Eleanor uses the mirrors to exact her vengeance on those responsible for her death, forcing them to confront their reflections that ultimately result in their demise. As Max moves closer to the truth, he becomes vulnerable to Eleanor's wrath. He tries to save his father from a similar fate, by asking the ghost to spare him in exchange for Max helping her bring those responsible to justice. In the end, Max confronts Keller Landreaux and Ryan Parker's accomplices, who ultimately face justice for their crimes. Eleanor's spirit finds solace in knowing her assailants have paid for their actions, and, taking Max's promise into account, she refrains from harming him or his father.

Movie plot title: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Movie plot: The Federation Starship Enterprise returns to Earth following a battle with the superhuman Khan Noonien Singh, who tried to destroy the Enterprise by detonating an experimental terraforming device known as Genesis. The casualties of the fight include Admiral James T. Kirk's Vulcan friend, Spock, whose casket was launched into space and eventually landed on the planet created by the Genesis Device. On arriving at Earth Spacedock, Doctor Leonard McCoy begins to act strangely and is detained. Starfleet Admiral Morrow visits the Enterprise and informs the crew the ship is to be decommissioned; the crew is ordered not to speak about Genesis due to political fallout over the device. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick)âKirk's son, a key scientist in Genesis's developmentâand Lieutenant Saavik (Robin Curtis) are investigating the Genesis planet on board the science vessel Grissom. Discovering an unexpected life form on the surface, Marcus and Saavik transport to the planet. They find that the Genesis Device has resurrected Spock in the form of a child, although his mind is not present. Marcus admits that he used unstable \\"protomatter\\" in the development of the Genesis Device, causing Spock to age rapidly and meaning the planet will be destroyed within hours. Meanwhile, Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), the commander of a Klingon vessel, intercepts information about Genesis. Believing the device to be potentially useful as a weapon, he takes his cloaked ship to the Genesis planet, destroys the Grissom, and takes hostage Marcus, Saavik, and Spock. Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), confronts Kirk about his son's death. The pair learn that before he died, Spock transferred his katra, or living spirit, to McCoy. Spock's katra and body are needed to lay him to rest on his homeworld, Vulcan, and without help, McCoy will die from carrying the katra. Disobeying orders, Kirk and his officers spring McCoy from detention, disable the USS Excelsior, and steal the Enterprise from Spacedock to return to the Genesis planet to retrieve...

Are you a gifted athlete? When you and your friends get together to play sports, are you always the first picked, or the one to score the most points? If so, you might have the makings of a sports star. Do you love music? Do you enjoy singing, playing an instrument, or dancing to music, you might have the makings of a pop star, a singer, or a rock star. Do you have the gift of gab?

Do you enjoy movies, plays, and television? Do people ever tell you that you have a dramatic presence? If you're a good actor or actress, movie stardom might be in the cards. . Developing your talents into a star-level degree of skill will require help. Whether you want to go pro in acting or sports, politics or music, you've got to get insider info and learn to hone your skills from an expert in the field. Start taking acting or music lessons.

They were self-published, at the cost of 400 by Ben's parents. Over the past five years, print-on-demand technology and a growing number of self publishing companies whose books can be sold online have inspired writers of all ages to avoid the traditional gatekeeping system for determining who could call himself a \\"published author.\\" The mothers and fathers who foot the bill say they are simply trying to encourage their children, in the same way that other parents buy equipment for a promising baseball player. But others see self-publishing as a lost opportunity to teach children about hardship and perseverance. Mr. Robbins, a critic, thinks it is wonderful to start writing at a young age, but worries self-publishing sends the wrong message. \\"There are no prodigies  in literature,\\" he said. \\"Literature requires experience, in a way that mathematics and music do not.\\" Alan Rinzler, a publishing industry veteran, suggested parents hire a professional editor like him to work with their child to tear a manuscript apart and help make a better.

Read this article and answer this question In what was, at the time, the most-watched NFL regular season game since 1996, the Patriots faced the Cowboys, the NFC's only remaining unbeaten team. The Patriots' first drive of the game spanned 74&#160;yards and ended in a 6-yard touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. After three punts, the Patriots' lead increased to 14-0 after another Brady touchdown pass, this one from 35&#160;yards out to Welker. In the second quarter, the Cowboys got on the scoreboard when they culminated a 64-yard, 10-play drive with a 38-yard field goal by Nick Folk. On their ensuing possession, the Patriots advanced 12&#160;yards before Brady was strip-sacked by defensive end Greg Ellis; defensive end Jason Hatcher recovered the ball and returned it 29&#160;yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 14-10. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 72-yard drive that ended on a 12-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Welker, his second of the day. The Cowboys then moved the ball 84&#160;yards, keeping pace with the Patriots when Tony Romo threw to Terrell Owens for a 12-yard touchdown grab of his own, giving the game a 21-17 score at halftime. In the third quarter, after a Patriots punt, an 8-yard touchdown catch from Romo to wide receiver Patrick Crayton put the Patriots behind 24-21. However, the Patriots offense continued to move the ball too, with a 77-yard drive ending on a one-yard touchdown reception by Kyle Brady. Following a Cowboys punt that gave the Patriots the ball in Cowboys territory, the Patriots appeared to extend their lead on a 43-yard Moss touchdown catch, but the play was reversed as Moss was found not have caught the ball. A roughing the passer penalty was called on the play, though, setting up a 45-yard Gostkowski field goal to make the score 31-24. The Cowboys would punt early in the fourth quarter. Four plays later, Brady threw his fifth touchdown pass of the day, a franchise record. Stallworth's 69-yard catch gave the Patriots a 38-24 lead, but the Cowboys quickly responded with a 72-yard kickoff returnby Tyson Thompson. The Cowboys turned that return into three points on a 23-yard field goal by Folk. The Patriots then ate more clock, moving 61&#160;yards in just over six minutes, adding to their lead on a 22-yard Gostkowski field goal. Romo was intercepted by Seau on the next play, allowing the Patriots to run out more clock before Kyle Eckel ran in for a 1-yard touchdown. Romo then kneeled to end the game with a 48-27 final.

Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of \\"Meat\\", and they get off to a rocky start. Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon), a \\"baseball groupie\\" and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the \\"Church of Baseball\\" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to \\"try out\\" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he \\"believes in\\", ending with \\"I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... Good night\\". Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname \\"Nuke\\"). Crash forces Nuke to learn \\"not to think\\" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his \\"heat\\" (fastballs). Crash also talks about the pleasure of life in \\"The Show\\" (Major League Baseball), which he briefly lived for \\"the 21 greatest days of my life\\" and to which he has tried for years to return.

Help as much as you can. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Listening to music can help me focus better. Since I discovered it two years ago,I've used music to get through boring work or to focus creatively. I've found that it can make even the dullest jobs enjoyable and help clear mental blocks to creativity. I first noticed the good effects of music while playing video games. It was a few days before Christmas in 2005 and I was playing online video games. My parents had just given me a new MP3,so I decided to listen to music through the headphones while I played. After a few minutes I noticed a great change in my style of play. I was playing more naturally. The music relaxed me,and,to a certain extent,distracted me from the game,allowing my subconscious talent to come through. The music also helped me block out the outside world. With those headphones on I was like a machine,moving from one task to the next without unnecessary thoughts or actions. Music can also have a great effect on mood. If I'm in a bad mood at work,I'll listen to some of Bob Marley's and get down to business. It always takes my mind off what I'm doing and makes me a happier person. The same is true for classic rock. One summer,I did a boring job collecting bottle openers by hand. Without a radio playing classic rock in the background,I would have hated life. Listening to music with relaxing rhythms and a positive message helps you forget your work and think happy thoughts. But the results you see will depend heavily on your personal tastes. Experiment with the types of music you listen to during certain tasks. By trial and error you'll finally discover your best choice. I'm always looking for new concentration aids,so I'd love to know what type of music works best for me. Question: We can infer that the passage was written in   _  .

Which city is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first?  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later.

When you uninstall a program, certutil.exe may be mistakenly deleted. Let's break down this text for better understanding: Uninstallation: Uninstalling a program refers to the process of removing software or applications from a computer system. This process typically involves deleting all the files related to the installed program, and even modifying the registry or other system parameters to revert back to their pre-installation state. DLL files: Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) files are essential components that are used by various programs and applications on a computer. They include libraries of functions, data, and other resources that can be shared by multiple programs. DLL files foster efficient management of system resources and help avoid duplication of code and data. Shared data and functions: Since DLL files are designed to provide functionality and resources to multiple applications, they inherently contain shared data, functions, and other information. This allows for more efficient use of system resources and reduced redundancy. Certutil.exe: Certutil.exe is a command-line utility that is used for managing certificates on a Windows system. It allows administrators to perform certificate-related tasks such as viewing, installing, updating, or deleting certificates. It also helps in troubleshooting and diagnosing certificate issues. Mistakenly deleted: The deletion of certutil.exe by accident or as part of an uninstallation process of another program can result in a lost or corrupted executable file, which may lead to the malfunctioning or failure of the programs relying on it. In summary, the uninstallation of a program might lead to the accidental deletion of essential files such as certutil.exe, which can affect the functioning of other programs and software on the system due to their reliance on the shared resources available in these DLL files.

Does the word \\"substitute\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"In both sentences, the word \\"substitute\\" shares a common theme of one thing replacing or standing in for another thing. However, the context in which the word \\"substitute\\" is used in these sentences is different, making the meaning of the word differ between the two instances. In the first sentence, \\"The young teacher had to substitute for the sick colleague,\\" the word \\"substitute\\" is used as a verb to describe the action taken by the young teacher. In this context, \\"substitute\\" means to take the place of or perform the duties of someone else, usually on a temporary basis. The young teacher is stepping in to fulfill the role and responsibilities of the sick colleague, ensuring that their job is taken care of until the sick colleague is able to return to work. The usage of \\"substitute\\" here is primarily associated with a temporary replacement of a person in a specific position or role. In the second sentence, \\"The skim milk substitutes for cream -- we are on a strict diet,\\" the word \\"substitute\\" is also used as a verb, but the context shifts from replacing people or roles to replacing objects or ingredients in this case. Thus, \\"substitute\\" in this context means to replace one thing with another, usually due to the necessity of a specific outcome, such as adhering to a strict diet in this example. Skim milk is being used in place of cream, which may be due to reasons like lower fat content and fewer calories. The meaning of \\"substitute\\" in this sentence is focused on replacing an object or ingredient to achieve a desired result or meet specific requirements. In summary, while the word \\"substitute\\" generally denotes the act of replacement in both sentences, the specific meaning and context of usage differ between the two. In the first sentence, \\"substitute\\" refers to the temporary replacement of a person in a role or position, while in the second sentence, it refers to the replacement of an object or ingredient to achieve a specific outcome or adhere to certain requirements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Veronika Decides to Die Movie plot: A train in New York City carries passengers to work, including Veronika Deklava (Sarah Michelle Gellar). We see Veronika walking the streets of Manhattan, working at her job, meeting a young man for a drink afterward, and finally going home. During this time, she gives a voiceover as if talking to a psychiatrist who she thinks will put her on antidepressants, and she gives a prediction of her life all the way to her old age.At home, Veronika pours herself a drink and takes a number of prescription medications out of her bathroom medicine cabinet. She arranges the bottles in a line on her coffee table, and then lays out a number of pills. Putting on some music, Veronika swallows the pills one by one, washing them down with her drink.As the pills take effect, Veronika starts to type out an email to her parents, ominously telling them that none of what is about to happen, is their fault. Deleting the email, she picks up a fashion magazine and instead begins to type out an email to the Village Voice, lambasting them over a fashion slogan she sees as a lie. In the email Veronika lashes out at media and corporate misleading of the public to things that Veronika believes, really matter in life... and that she's committing suicide as the only viable escape from a world she sees as unreal.But in signing her real name, Veronika has not reckoned with the power of the internet. Within minutes, viewers have shared and spread the email, and traced it back to her, and a man is banging on her door even as she collapses in her living room. Bursting into the apartment, the man bends over Veronika, feeling for a pulse, and yells for 911 to be called.

Does it follow that \\"There is no waste whatsoever on the railroad, due to careful planning.\\"? Choices:  1). yes.  2). it is not possible to tell.  3). no.","output":"3). No. While careful planning can significantly reduce waste and inefficiencies in the railroad industry, stating that \\"there is no waste whatsoever on the railroad, due to careful planning\\" would be an overstatement. In any large infrastructure system such as the railroad industry, there will be some level of waste or inefficiencies, even with meticulous planning. Let's break it down: 1. Coordination failures: As you mentioned, in the early days of railroads, each line had a different gauge, leading to coordination failures and waste. This inefficiency was later reduced by adopting standardized gauges worldwide, but there still might be occasional compatibility issues when interacting with older infrastructure or railroads in remote regions that do not follow the standard. Moreover, challenges arising from coordination among multiple railroad companies, scheduling, and resource allocation continue to contribute to some level of waste. 2. Human errors: No matter how well-designed a system is, human errors can happen, which can lead to waste. For instance, employees might make mistakes in loading, scheduling, or operating trains. Proper training, technological advancements, and strict operational guidelines can limit these errors, but eliminating them completely is highly unlikely. 3. Economic factors: Fluctuations in demand for rail transportation or changes in global trade patterns can sometimes lead to empty or underutilized railcars, which generates waste as they still consume resources such as fuel and labor. While some of these fluctuations can be anticipated and planned for, predicting every change is not feasible. 4. Maintenance and asset management: Railroads require ongoing maintenance and asset management to ensure efficiency. With wear and tear, rail infrastructure and rolling stock require repair or replacement due to damage or technological obsolescence. This process can experience inefficiencies, such as delays in procuring parts or completing repairs, which can contribute to waste in the system. 5. Environmental factors: Weather-related disruptions, such as storms or floods, can cause temporary or permanent damage to rail infrastructure, increasing inefficiencies. Although precautionary measures and risk mitigation plans can help reduce the impact of such events, completely avoiding the waste caused by these unpredictable occurrences is unlikely. In conclusion, while careful planning and advanced technology can significantly minimize waste in the railroad industry, it is implausible to claim that there will be no waste whatsoever. There will always be some level of waste due to unexpected events, human errors, and the ever-evolving nature of the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Background: Rudolf Joseph Lorenz Steiner (27 (or 25) February 1861 - 30 March 1925) was an Austrian philosopher, social reformer, architect and esotericist. Steiner gained initial recognition at the end of the nineteenth century as a literary critic and published philosophical works including The Philosophy of Freedom. At the beginning of the twentieth century he founded an esoteric spiritual movement, anthroposophy, with roots in German idealist philosophy and theosophy; other influences include Goethean science and Rosicrucianism. In the first, more philosophically oriented phase of this movement, Steiner attempted to find a synthesis between science and spirituality. Context: Steiner's father, Johann(es) Steiner (1829 - 1910), left a position as a gamekeeper in the service of Count Hoyos in Geras, northeast Lower Austria to marry one of the Hoyos family's housemaids, Franziska Blie (1834 Horn - 1918, Horn), a marriage for which the Count had refused his permission. Johann became a telegraph operator on the Southern Austrian Railway, and at the time of Rudolf's birth was stationed in Kraljevec in the Murakoz region of the Austrian Empire (present-day Donji Kraljevec in the Medimurje region of northernmost Croatia). In the first two years of Rudolf's life, the family moved twice, first to Modling, near Vienna, and then, through the promotion of his father to stationmaster, to Pottschach, located in the foothills of the eastern Austrian Alps in Lower Austria.  Steiner entered the village school; following a disagreement between his father and the schoolmaster, he was briefly educated at home. In 1869, when Steiner was eight years old, the family moved to the village of Neudorfl and in October 1872 Steiner proceeded from the village school there to the realschule in Wiener Neustadt.  In 1879, the family moved to Inzersdorf to enable Steiner to attend the Vienna Institute of Technology, where he studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, biology, literature, and philosophy on an academic scholarship from 1879 to 1883, at the end of which time he withdrew from the institute without graduating. In 1882, one of Steiner's teachers, Karl Julius Schroer, suggested Steiner's name to Joseph Kurschner, chief editor of a new edition of Goethe's works, who asked Steiner to become the edition's natural science editor, a truly astonishing opportunity for a young student without any form of academic credentials or previous publications.  Before attending the Vienna Institute of Technology, Steiner had studied Kant, Fichte and Schelling. Question: Did any of is professors have an impact on his life? Answer:","output":"Yes, several of Rudolf Steiner's professors and teachers had a significant impact on his life, influencing his thoughts, work, and career trajectory. One particularly influential teacher to Steiner was Karl Julius Schröer (1825–1900), whom he met while attending the Vienna Institute of Technology. Schröer was a philologist, literary historian, and an expert in the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He recognized Steiner's aptitude for the natural sciences and his deep interest in Goethe's works. Schröer recommended Steiner's name to Joseph Kürschner, the chief editor of a new edition of Goethe's works, leading to Steiner's appointment as the natural science editor for the project. This opportunity allowed Steiner to delve deeper into Goethe's worldview and refine his own perspectives on the synthesis of science and spirituality. In addition to Schröer, Steiner was influenced by the ideas of several philosophers and idealist thinkers during his time at the Vienna Institute of Technology. Before attending the institute, he had already studied the works of Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. These philosophers contributed significantly to Steiner's intellectual development, shaping his perspectives on the relationship between the material and the spiritual world. The education Steiner received at the institute further exposed him to various scientific disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, and biology. This broad base of knowledge would later allow him to integrate scientific principles with his spiritual views in the formation of the anthroposophical movement. In summary, Rudolf Steiner's life and work were unmistakably impacted by his professors and the education he received. Their guidance, along with Steiner's engagement with the works of significant philosophers and scientists, allowed him to develop and articulate his unique perspectives on the synthesis of science and spirituality in his later life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is a main character in the book series written by Norman Bridwell, which began in 1963, and the subsequent animated television series that followed. Emily Elizabeth is a caring and kind-hearted young girl who is the owner and best friend of Clifford, the titular Big Red Dog. She is characterized by her strong bond with and unwavering love for her oversized canine companion. Emily Elizabeth received Clifford as a tiny red puppy from an animal rescue. She chose him out of all the puppies because of their instant connection and her assurance that she could love him more than anyone else in the world. Due to her tremendous love, Clifford grew into a gigantic dog, a defining characteristic of the series. Emily Elizabeth's name in the books and show is actually a tribute to the author Norman Bridwell's own daughter, whose name is also Emily Elizabeth. The Clifford the Big Red Dog stories revolve around the humorous and adventurous escapades of Clifford and Emily Elizabeth, along with their friends and neighbors on Birdwell Island. Emily Elizabeth's youthful voice of reason, wisdom, and kindness helps to resolve many of the characters' various dilemmas and, ultimately, sets an example of how love, patience, and understanding can create positive changes in the world.

Review: talked all the way through it  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence can be perceived as negative, as it seems to be expressing discontent with the experience of attending the movie screening. The phrase \\"talked all the way through it\\" implies that there was an excessive amount of conversation throughout the movie, which could have been distracting and diminishing the overall enjoyment for the person who wrote the review. It is important to note that people have varying opinions and preferences regarding their experiences, and while this review may seem negative to some, others might interpret the statement as a matter of personal preference. Some individuals may enjoy having discussions and sharing opinions during a movie, as it fosters a sense of camaraderie and engagement. However, in the typical context of attending a movie screening, where the environment is meant to be quiet and focused on the audiovisual elements of the film, such behavior may be considered rude, disruptive, and unappreciative of the artistry and narrative of the film. In general, the goal of attending a movie is to immerse oneself in the cinematic experience, which can be compromised by constant talking during the movie. As a result, the review sentence provided can be categorized as predominantly negative. It suggests that the writer's experience of watching the movie was affected by people constantly talking, leaving them with a less-than-ideal impression. Additionally, it might even indicate that the film did not hold the viewer's attention enough to prevent them from talking throughout the movie.

The reviewer expresses disappointment in several aspects of the book, which ultimately leads to a negative impression of the product. Here's a breakdown of the criticisms mentioned in the review: 1. Discrepancy between the book's premise and its execution: The reviewer acknowledges the witty idea of presenting scenes supposedly cut from Jane Austen novels by censors. However, they believe that the actual content of the book falls short of this inventive claim, as the scenes were likely removed for editorial reasons rather than censorship. 2. Writing style: The author of the book is criticized for failing to emulate Jane Austen's writing style convincingly. According to the reviewer, the essays in the book come across as \\"precious\\" instead of mimicking the authentic tone of Austen's novels. 3. Prose quality: The reviewer refers to the book's prose as \\"leaden,\\" which suggests that they find the writing dull, monotonous, and lacking vitality. This further emphasizes the discrepancy between the book's innovative premise and the actual content. 4. Lack of passion: Despite the book's intent to provide an erotic take on classic literature, the reviewer finds it \\"surprisingly passionless,\\" implying that the book does not deliver on its promised exploration of sensuality. 5. Ineffectiveness in eroticizing the classics: The reviewer explicitly states that they have no objection to the concept of adding erotic elements to classic literature. However, they believe that this book fails to \\"pull it off\\" in many ways, further highlighting the gap between the book's premise and its execution.

Here is an article: Chances are that if you are reading this in or near New York City now, meaning sometime between the 22nd and 26th day of the seventh month of the 17th year of the 21st century, you are very hot. You are almost assuredly irritated as well as hot, because as Samantha Gillison recently put it in a column in The Guardian, explaining New York summers to those fortunate enough to spend them in London, “Being confronted by your own cosmic insignificance as you struggle through an inferno to get to your dumb job can be a deeply unpleasant sensation.” Summer in New York demands an inner reckoning, she suggested, a re-evaluation of every life choice you’ve ever made. What are you doing here? If you are a parent keeping a child in the city on an especially brutal weekend, when you might simply be forced to stay inside revisiting the entire Pixar canon, it can feel as if you are imposing what would count as a code-red abuse among the affluenza class, roughly equivalent to permitting the consumption of a street vendor’s hot dog. During periods of intense heat, mayors stress the importance of air-conditioning, as Bill de Blasio did this month, while also stressing that you shouldn’t use too much of it. Setting temperatures below 78 degrees is bad citizenship because it can threaten the power grid. Air-conditioning is never quite right in New York, as anyone who has lived here knows — in offices it is too cold; in homes it is not cold enough. Water, of course, is elusive. This year, though, the mayor committed to keeping certain large public pools open until 8 p.m. and playground sprinklers on until dark. He also reminded New Yorkers that they can travel to a local fire station — if they are able to prove that they are 18 or older — and obtain a spray cap with which to open a fire hydrant safely. But fire hydrants are not the Adirondacks or the Atlantic Ocean. Perhaps it was inevitable that the sharing economy would, in all its professed virtue, come up with a way to make you feel as if you owned a summer place when you didn’t have one. A few weeks ago came the birth of Second House, a club in which you apply to spend one weekend or many in a well-appointed home out of the city with strangers, vetted by the company to ensure not only that the strangers in question are disinclined to extreme lunacy but that they are, as the website puts it, “creative, entrepreneurial, soulful, independent, globally minded, optimistic, social, innovative and fun-loving.” The idea is to build a collection of these houses no more than two and a half hours outside major cities around the world. Second House will rent or buy them or manage them for people who use their vacation homes infrequently. The first and only house so far went into full operation, on the North Fork of Long Island, during the first weekend in July, with membership at 2,000 for 24 days of tenancy. No more than 10 people are ever together at once. A host from the company is always present. Families are welcome, sometimes, particularly those with a single child who are not averse to co-sleeping. A better world through the disruption of the Hamptons summer share! The company was developed by a group of women, one a former banker from the Netherlands who worked for years in Milan and reveled in the particularities of bourgeois Italian weekend rituals — you always left the city and always to join big groups of friends and family. A company representative meets applicants beforehand, although one meeting does not necessarily prove sanity. So there are recurring events in the city where company members and potential guests can engage one another. And these events require you to do more than sit around and drink rosé. You get together to learn about natural nutrition or to view an exhibition of photographs from Burma or to learn about the interplay of architecture, mood and health, the subject of a recent discussion that included a representative from an outfit called Delos, which bills itself as the world’s first “wellness” real estate firm. (Because when you think of self-restoration and reducing anxiety, you always think of Manhattan real estate.) There are also communal dinners in town, and if the vetting process fails — if a selfish bore who takes the last glass of orange juice in the morning and demands that Fox News be on all day somehow slips through — the offending party will never be invited back to the house. “It doesn’t appeal to everyone,” one of the people at Second House told me, “which is a good thing.” For the lumps and the losers, the loudmouths and the guys who’ll cheat at Boggle, there is always the local hook and ladder and a cold spritz.

Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  and the situation: Iran an Iraq are 2 neighbors. Iraq produces its electricity by burning fossil fuels, while Iran uses nuclear fission as its energy source.  Answer the following question: Which country causes more environmental problems?

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What volcano has a cone tht consists of basaltic andesite along with red scoria and tephra  South Sister, also known as \\"Charity\\", is the tallest volcano of the trio, standing at 10,363 feet (3,159 m). The eruptive products range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite. It is a predominantly rhyolitic stratovolcano overlying an older shield structure. Its modern structure is no more than 50,000 years old, and it last erupted about 2,000 years ago. Although its first eruptive events from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago were predominantly rhyolitic, between 38,000 and 32,000 years ago the volcano began to alternate between dacitic/rhyodacitic and rhyolitic eruptions. The volcano built a broad andesitic cone, forming a steep summit cone of andesite about 27,000 years ago. South Sister remained dormant for 15,000 years, after which its composition shifted from dacitic to more rhyolitic lava. An eruptive episode about 2,200 years ago, termed the Rock Mesa eruptive cycle, first spread volcanic ash from flank vents from the south and southwest flanks, followed by a thick rhyolite lava flow. Next, the Devils Hill eruptive cycle consisted of explosive ash eruptions followed by viscous rhyolitic lava flows. Unlike the previous eruptive period, it was caused by the intrusion of a dike of new silicic magma that erupted from 20 vents on the southeast side and from a smaller line on the north side. These eruptions generated pyroclastic flows and lava domes from vents on the northern, southern, eastern, and southeastern sides of the volcano. These relatively recent, postglacial eruptions suggest the presence of a silicic magma reservoir under South Sister, one that could perhaps lead to future eruptions. Unlike its sister peaks, South Sister has an uneroded summit crater about 0.25 mi (0.40 km) in diameter that holds a small crater lake known as Teardrop Pool, the highest lake in Oregon. Its cone consists of basaltic andesite along with red scoria and tephra, with exposed black and red inner walls made of scoria.

All three major party leaders signed up to a \\"vow\\" to deliver further devolution last September. The move was a bid to head off a Yes vote in the independence referendum. The Smith Commission drew up proposals for change within three months of the vote. In the new report, the House of Lords Constitution Committee said the party leaders' public commitment to change appeared to have \\"pre-empted any meaningful scrutiny\\" of the proposals by the public or parliaments in Westminster and Holyrood. It voiced \\"deep concern\\" at the speed with which Lord Smith of Kelvin was told to complete his work, which did not allow \\"adequate time for engagement and consultation\\". The committee expressed \\"astonishment\\" that the UK government \\"do not appear to have considered the wider implications for the United Kingdom of the proposals\\". It said it was \\"not appropriate or sustainable\\" to address the issues of additional powers for Scotland alone without considering the knock-on consequences for the wider UK constitution. The report found the process leading up to the proposals being set out \\"does not meet the expected standard for implementing proposals for constitutional change\\" and \\"undermines confidence in the outcome\\". The UK Parliament should not \\"simply accept these significant constitutional changes as a fait accompli\\" but should \\"ensure they receive the detailed scrutiny they require and any amendment that may be necessary\\", the report continued. Committee chairman Lord Lang of Monkton said: \\"The recommendations in the Smith Commission report clearly have profound constitutional implications for every part of the UK. \\"However, the UK Parliament is expected to pass these proposals into law without significant amendment despite having been, in effect, excluded from the decision-making process. This is not the way to implement significant constitutional change. \\"We were astonished to hear that the government have not properly considered the impact on the rest of the UK of implementing the Smith Commission proposals. Piecemeal, ad hoc changes to the Scottish devolution settlement without wider consideration of their impact could well destabilise the Union as a whole in the longer term.\\" Lord Lang added: \\"The major UK-wide political parties need urgently to devise and articulate a vision for the future shape of the Union and its devolution settlements. Without this, there cannot be any long-term constitutional stability.\\" The UK government said it was \\"committed to a balanced settlement for all parts of the UK\\".

The Committee's report today responds to that request for feedback and we will consider the recommendations made by the Committee. \\"Following the general election the three pro-UK parties in Scotland have all committed to bring forward a bill in the next session of Parliament where both the UK Parliament and Scottish Parliament will be able to consider and scrutinise the Bill in the normal way.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"The leaders of the three major parties agreed to give more power to Scotland last year, so that Scotland would not want to become an independent country.

Background: Rahul Bose was born to Rupen and Kumud Bose on 27 July 1967. He describes himself as \\"...half Bengali; one-fourth Punjabi and one-fourth Maharashtrian.\\" Bose's first acting role was at age six when he played the lead in a school play, Tom, the Piper's Son. Context: Bose assisted in the relief efforts in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. As a result of this work, Bose launched the Andaman and Nicobar Scholarship Initiative through his NGO, The Foundation. The scholarship program provides for the education of underprivileged children from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Bose is associated with several charitable organizations such as Teach for India, Akshara Centre, Breakthrough, Citizens for Justice and Peace and the Spastics Society of India.

Options: - bar - human being - cemetary - graveyard - earth The answer to this question is:","output":"human being. The most suitable option to answer the given question about the spirit that ascended to the afterlife is \\"human being.\\" To understand this choice, it's essential to consider the concept of the spirit and its relationship with the human experience. In most belief systems and philosophical schools of thought, the spirit is considered an integral part of an individual's existence. It is often described as the essence or soul, the part of a person's being that transcends the tangible aspects of life like the physical body and material experiences. The spirit is commonly believed to represent the core of consciousness, emotions, and personal identity. When discussing the afterlife, many cultures and religions hold that the human spirit exits the physical body upon death and continues to exist in another realm or state of being. This belief is often rooted in the idea that there is more to life than the temporary, material world, and that the spirit is an eternal, non-physical entity capable of experiencing the afterlife. Given this context, it makes the most sense to choose \\"human being\\" as the answer to the question. This is because when the spirit ascends to the afterlife, it is leaving the human body and the physical world behind and embarking on a new journey or state of existence. Although graveyards, cemeteries, and earth as a whole are related to the experience of human life and death, none of these options point to the specific element that the spirit is parting from – the human being. It is essential to acknowledge that different belief systems and cultures might have various interpretations and understanding of the concept of the spirit, the afterlife, and their connection to the world we inhabit. The answer provided here is a general explanation grounded in the information provided in the question and popular beliefs surrounding the spirit's departure from a human being in most belief systems."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands? is inside the article: With their love of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion \\"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\\"; Descendents \\"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\\". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \\"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\\", can you guess it ?","output":"The article does not provide the full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands.

The trauma activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he kills Thomas, who reveals that he is James's real father. James flees along with Thomas's son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James defends Victor and the two are sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody, and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but the group's (especially Victor's) disregard for human life causes James to leave. Six years later, James (now using the name Logan) is working as a lumberjack in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero approach Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed, and he thinks someone is targeting the team's members.

ISDA PRESS REPORT - OCTOBER 23, 2001  CREDIT DERIVATIVES \\t*\\tISDA clears way for Railtrack convertible delivery - IFR  TRADING PRACTICE \\t*\\tInvestment banks offer derivatives services to clients - Financial Times  WEATHER DERIVATIVES \\t*\\tEvery cloud...? - FOW  ISDA clears way for Railtrack convertible delivery IFR - October 23, 2001  A UK lawyer retained by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association last Thursday advised that convertible bonds in their normal form meet the \\"not-contingent\\" clause of ISDA's standard credit derivatives definitions. This cleared the way for banks to accept delivery of Railtrack's ?400m 2009 convertible under existing default swaps. Around ?75m of convertibles had been delivered under default swap exercises by the close of trading on Friday. Although banks and other protection sellers will now realise some losses on acceptance of the Railtrack convertible, compared with accepting Railtrack's straight debt, the advice from Robin Potts QC was welcomed by the heads of credit derivatives at the major dealers. The legal opinion in effect removes one of the last main uncertainties about the enforceability of default swaps, and should allow increased sales of credit derivatives to convertible bond buyers. \\"The market has demonstrated its maturity,\\" said the head of credit derivatives trading at one bank. \\"All the major houses are now accepting convertibles as deliverables.\\" A London-based lawyer was chosen to provide the advice because the UK is the regime with the main legal question marks about deliverability of convertible bonds under default swap contracts, as well as the home of Railtrack. European convertibles typically feature a trustee with the responsibility to exercise conversion rights if a stock price moves a certain way beyond the strike price on a convertible bond. Banks had worried that this \\"widows and orphans\\" feature of convertible bonds could be interpreted to mean that the holder of a bond did not have full rights over its disposal, and that the deal would not therefore be deliverable under standard default swap language. The finding that convertibles are not contingent, whether they have a trustee or not, and therefore are deliverable under default swaps, unless specified otherwise, brought the price of the convertible bond closer to that of the cheapest to deliver of Railtrack's straight bonds, its S150m 2028 issue. The convertible had been trading as low as 80 early last week, while the 2028 bond had been trading around 90. By the close of trading on Friday, however, the convertible was priced at 84, bid only, while the 2028 bond was at 87.75/88.5. Assuming that default swap exercises were around these levels, the total cost to protection sellers of the Potts opinion would have been roughly ?3m, when comparing the cost of accepting ?75m of the convertible with delivery of the straight bond. This cost will rise slightly, as the gap between the prices of the convertible and the straight issue is likely to narrow further before more exercises are completed. Bank derivatives heads generally view the short-term cost as negligible compared with the benefit of some assurance that convertibles are deliverable. The advice from Potts does not carry the same weight as a court judgement, but as the price of the convertible has appreciated, there is little chance that an end investor in a synthetic securitisation or credit-linked note will mount a legal challenge to try to stop a bank from accepting delivery of the convertible. The banks that arrange these structured trades normally have the responsibility for handling any default swap exercises on the credits included. ISDA will soon unveil new detailed guidance on credit derivatives written on convertible debt, including the zerocoupon bonds that have been a major feature of issuance this year. Investment banks offer derivatives services to clients  Financial Times - October 23, 2001 By John Labate  JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are the latest firms to offer new derivatives services to their clients. The two investment banks are expected to announce the first licensing agreements today with Longitude, a Manhattan-based online derivatives platform that will also launch today. The agreements give both firms exclusive licenses to offer derivatives trading in a unique series of products. Derivative services allow companies and other institutions to offset the risks that are inherent in a number of their investments or commercial activities. Traditionally, the risks that have been hedged have been limited to things traded already, such as stocks, bonds or currencies. Longitude was founded in 1999 and offers a service to run auction-based hedging services for \\"events of economic significance that cannot be hedged currently in the derivatives markets\\", according to chief executive Andrew Lawrence. Mr Lawrence, a former hedge fund executive, says in its initial phase, the company will offer JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank clients derivatives and risk management services for economic statistics. In the near term, other derivatives services will be launched through Longitude to hedge the weather, equity prices, mortgage payments data, central bank target rates, and to cover other areas. JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank did not state the amounts of their spending for their licenses or the length of those contracts with Longitude. \\"This differentiates us as a provider of cutting-edge derivatives products,\\" said Chris Harvey, managing director at JP Morgan. \\"There is no direct mechanism in the capital markets for clients to take views or hedge exposure to underlying economic variables.\\" Longitude's founders designed the system to simulate auction systems where prices were set without the need to match buyers and sellers in the market. The system is similar to betting that occurs at horse tracks, where the prices are based on all \\"bets\\". Once the hedged event occurs, the many separate claims are paid from the hedges placed in the system. Every cloud...? FOW - October 2001  It would have been tempting, in 1997, to believe that the art of financial risk management had reached a zenith. That was the year innovative energy companies demonstrated that derivatives could be used to hedge the financial impact of one of the most powerful and unpredictable variables confronting business managers - Mother Nature. According to the US Department of Commerce, at least 1 trillion of the US economy is sensitive to the vagaries of the weather, including vast portions of the energy, manufacturing, retailing, tourism and agriculture industries. Yet it was only with the development of weather derivatives that companies gained the ability to protect their financial results from significant but non-catastrophic weather events such as excessive heat, precipitation or wind risks that few traditional insurance policies could efficiently cover. Today, it is clear that the trading of the world's first weather derivative - a temperature collar executed between Koch Industries and Enron - marked the dawn of a new era in risk management, not the crowning of an old one. It signaled the creation of a trading market fundamentally more efficient than insurance, which, after all, requires insurers to retain their clients' risk and to charge a risk premium for providing that service. A trading market, by contrast, matches principals on either side of a risk, eliminating the need for a risk premium. The result is a less costly, more efficient means of risk transfer. Not surprisingly, companies whose financial results are sensitive to the weather have been flocking to this new market. The cumulative notional value of all weather derivatives executed since 1997 exceeds 7.5 billion. Meanwhile, leading-edge traders are continuing to develop a seemingly endless stream of new products that give companies the opportunity to hedge all sorts of risks once considered unmanageable, from advertising costs to river flows. However, it is obvious that this new market still confronts numerous challenges. Whole industries need to be educated in the use and value of derivatives. Governments in the US and abroad must be shown that market-oriented solutions to risk management can be more effective, and more efficient for consumers, than regulatory solutions. (Some US regulators still allow utilities to recoup the cost of bad weather from their ratepayers through inefficient weather normalisation clauses, for example.) In some regions of the world and some market niches, data for indices that underlie these new products must become more rigorously standardised and more widely available. Despite these challenges, the opportunities are nearly limitless. The past half-decade has shown that nearly any high-volume product, service or business variable that can be measured can be commoditised, and that anything that can be commoditised can be traded. Enron began proving this idea in 1989, when deregulation of the natural gas industry was forcing companies to change the way they contracted for gas in the wholesale market. That year, Enron executed the world's first natural-gas swap to meet the needs of a customer that wanted to lock in a fixed price for its gas purchases. To make the deal work, Enron agreed to absorb the cost, or benefit, of monthly spot gas purchases tied to a published index. Five years after creating what would become the precursor to today's wholesale gas trading business, Enron began migrating its gas trading expertise into other markets, beginning with electrical power. In 1997, it completed the world's first weather trade. Two years later, the company's newly formed Enron Broadband Services unit debuted its Enron Intelligent Network, an Internet application delivery platform, that later led to Enron's first bandwidth trade. That year also marked the launch of EnronOnline. There, companies can buy and sell a vast array of physical commodities and related derivatives contracts in markets as diverse as natural gas; power; emission allowances; bandwidth; weather derivatives; NGLs, petrochemicals and plastics; coal; crude oil; pulp and paper; credit derivatives; shipping; steel and metals. However, the idea of hedging risk with derivatives is not a new one. As early as the 12th century, vendors at European trade fairs were signing contracts for future delivery of goods. Futures contracts were part of tulip mania in Holland in the early 1600s. In that same century, the Japanese created a futures market in rice at Dojima, near Osaka, to protect sellers from bad weather or warfare. In 17868, the Chicago Board of Trade began trading wheat, pork belly and copper futures. Today, the range of commodities and risks that can be traded are limited only by imagination and determination. The weather market A closer look at the development of the weather market illustrates the opportunity. According to a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Weather Risk Management Association, the number of weather contracts executed in the 12 months ended April 14, 2001 rose by 1150/0, to 2,759, from the comparable year-earlier period. While the total notional value of weather derivatives traded during that time declined 17%, to 2.5 billion, the downturn appears to have been a consequence of happenstance - in this case, mild temperatures during the winters of 1997, 1998 and 1999 in North America, where more than 95% of all contracts were executed. Those temperate winters, the survey managers theorise, likely caused buyers of temperature-related weather derivatives to demand less protection against the possibility of an unusually cold winter in 2000. While temperature-related weather contracts remain, for the moment, the most popular type of weather derivative, there are signs that the market is broadening. While temperature-linked contracts accounted for 98.30/0 of all contracts traded during the first three and-a-half years of the market's development, for example, contracts linked to other measures accounted for 7.2% of all contracts written during the six months ended April 14, 2001. We can expect this broadening of the market to continue as new products give companies the power to more precisely hedge their risks. Prime examples introduced recently include power demand swaps and cross-commodity options. Demand swaps are designed to overcome one of the biggest pitfalls of weather derivatives: they can protect companies against swings in demand -either for","output":"The subject line for this email could be: \\"ISDA News and Updates: Credit Derivatives, Trading Practices, and Weather Derivatives - October 23, 2001\\" This email talks about news and updates related to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).

Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit  of measure  called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage?

Read this article and answer this question In a thrilling back and forth affair, the Patriots managed a sensational comeback against the undefeated Saints. Following the opening kickoff, Brady put together a 14-play 60-yard drive. The Patriots drove to the Saints 12, but on 3rd-and-7 Tom Brady was sacked for a 5-yard loss forcing them to settle for Stephen Gostkowski's 35-yard field goal to take the opening lead 3-0. The Saints went 3-and-out on their opening drive and the Patriots followed that with a 3-and-out of their own. The Saints responded by marching 73 yards taking over five minutes off the clock  with Drew Brees tossing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Travaris Cadet. The Patriots immediately responded by slowly moving 80 yards to take a 10-7 lead on Stevan Ridley's 1-yard touchdown run. The Saints went 3-and-out yet again on their next drive and the Patriots took advantage with a long drive taking up 4:52 seconds in 12 plays as they marched 69 yards to increase their lead to 17-7 on another Stevan Ridley touchdown run, this one from 4 yards out. Punts filled the&#160;!of the half and the Patriots led 17-7 at halftime. The Saints took the opening kickoff of the second half 70 yards to the Patriots 10, but the Patriots kept them out of the end zone and Garrett Hartley kicked a 28-yard field goal to trim the lead 17-10. After a Patriots 3-and-out, the Saints stormed 67 yards with Khiry Robinson rushing for a 3-yard touchdown to suddenly tie the game at 17. The Patriots managed to respond on the follow-up drive marching 54 yards in 12 plays, but settled for Gostkowski's 54-yard field goal to retake the lead 20-17. Early in the fourth quarter on 3rd-and-12, the Drew Brees called a timeout to avoid delay of game, but the referees didn't see it so Brees was forced to snap the ball. Brees forced a pass intended for Jimmy Graham, but was by Kyle Arrington at the Saints 25 and returned for 5 yards to the Saints 20. The Patriots managed to reach the Saints 5-yard line, but were kept out of the end zone and Gostkowski kicked a 23-yard field goal to increase th Patriots lead to 23-17. The Saints immediately responded by storming 81 yards in 5:05 with Brees connecting with Kenny Stills on a 34-yard touchdown pass on 3rd-and-20, giving the Saints their second lead of the night 24-23. Four straight incompletions from Brady on the next drive seemingly ended the game, but the Patriots held the Saints to only three yards and Hartley kicked a 39-yard field goal to increase the lead to 27-23. Brady threw a seemingly game deciding interception with just 2:16 remaining but once again, the Patriots defense managed to hold the Saints to a 3-and-out (mostly due to the Saints erratic play calling). Brady got the ball back at his own 30 with 1:13 remaining and no timeouts, and mounted his 39th career game-winning drive. Tom Brady hit Edelman for 23 yards on the first play to move the ball to the Saints 47. He then completed passes to Austin Collie for 15 yards and Aaron Dobson for 6 yards moving the ball to the Saints 26-yard line with 0:35 seconds left. Back-to-back incompletions set up a 4th-and-4. Brady completed a pass to Collie again for 9 yards. Brady spiked the ball at the 17 with&#160;:10 seconds remaining. On the very next play, Brady connected with Thompkins for a 7-yard touchdown pass with five seconds remaining on the clock giving the Patriots the 30-27 lead. The Saints attempted a hook-and-lateral on the kickoff, but Darren Sproles fumbled and Jamie Collins recovered to end the game.

This corresponds to an annual growth rate of 1.4% , well above the world average of 0.9% .The population of Western Asia is estimated at about 4% of world population, up from about 39 million at the beginning of the 20th century, or about 2% of world population at the time. The most populous countries in the region are Turkey and Iran and, each with around 79 million people, followed by Iraq and Saudi Arabia with around 33 million people each. Numerically, Western Asia is predominantly Arab, Persian, Turkish, and the dominating languages are correspondingly Arabic, Persian and Turkish, each with of the order of 70 million speakers, followed by smaller communities of Kurdish, Azerbaijani, Hebrew, Armenian and Eastern Aramaic. The dominance of Arabic and Turkish is the result of the medieval Arab and Turkic invasions beginning with the Islamic conquests of the 7th century AD, which displaced the formerly dominant Aramaic and Hebrew in the Levant, and Greek in Anatolia, although Hebrew is once again the dominant language in Israel, and Aramaic  and Greek both remain present in their respective territories as minority languages. Other significant native minorities include Assyrians, Druze, Jews, Mandeans, Maronites, Shabaks, Syriac Arameans, Lurs and Yezidis.

Context: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November.

Answer: A:","output":"Rick Saccone is a strong supporter of President Donald Trump and was the Republican candidate in a closely contested special congressional election in Pennsylvania against Democrat Conor Lamb.

This move comes after years of campaigning by human rights activists, who have argued that the detainees have been subject to torture and other mistreatment. The families of the prisoners were granted rare permission to visit them in the Kuwaiti capital of Kuwait City. They were able to see their loved ones for the first time in many years, and to deliver vital supplies such as food and medicine. The prisoners themselves have been locked up in Kuwait since the end of the Gulf War, which saw a coalition of international forces led by the US push Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. The majority of the prisoners were captured during the conflict, and have been held in Kuwait ever since. In the years since the war, the conditions in which the prisoners have been held have been the subject of much controversy. Activists have claimed that they have been subject to torture and abuse, and that they have been denied access to medical care and legal representation. The visit by their relatives is a sign that the Kuwaiti authorities may finally be taking steps to improve the conditions of the detainees. However, human rights groups argue that much more needs to be done to protect the rights of the prisoners, and to ensure that they receive fair treatment under the law. As the families of the prisoners return home, they are left with a mixture of emotions. They are relieved to have seen their loved ones at last, but also frustrated by the apparent lack of progress in securing their release. For the time being, they can only hope that their visit will mark the start of a new era of improved treatment for the Iraqis who remain imprisoned in Kuwait."},{"instruction":"e gladly donned grass skirt , leis , shades and flowers in his hair .

Context: In 1901, 10inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an everdwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateralcut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing). Answer","output":"The 10-inch disc records could play for more than three minutes."},{"instruction":"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — Five suicide bombers stormed a government office in Kandahar on Wednesday morning, killing 13 people, including two provincial government officials, and wounding 14.

During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any longterm change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.
